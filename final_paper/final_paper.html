AI: What are mundane militarisms?: The study of unlearning traditional and institutional histories and disciplinary methods
The “surplus of everyday life,” with its “staggering complexities, “messy residues,” “untidiness,” complexities, “repetitions” and “endless incompletion” have all been just some of the theoretical frameworks that our semester-long seminar has engaged with in our attempts to demonstrate the interconnectedness between what we consider to be mundane and the meanings of war. Through the collection of object entries our seminar has compiled on Mundane Militarisms, our shared keyword definitions and class notes, and in our conversations with scholars across multiple disciplines every week, we have been answering the question of what constitutes war against the long-lasting conventions of history-writing, or what Muñoz describes as the “regime of rigor. ”  Thinking with Hartoonian and Muñoz, these expectations of history-writing, that in turn legitimize “regimes of rigor,” are founded upon the constant displacement of the “danger posed by the surplus of everyday life.” 
One example through which this obsession with “finding an encompassing register that will fix meaning” is manifested is the urge to periodize and/or linearize the spectacular or exceptional to strictly maintain the binary between “peacetime” and “wartime” as mentioned by Dudziak.  And yet, what is ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’? “The beginning of war is the opening of an era that will, by definition, come to an end.”  Yet, “when we look at the full timeline of American military conflicts, including the “small wars” and the so-called forgotten wars, there are not many years of peacetime. This shows us that war is not an exception to normal peacetime, but instead an enduring condition.”  This theorization carries concerning consequences. “If we abandon the idea that war is confined in time we can see more clearly that our law and politics are not suspended by an exception to the regular order of things. Instead, wartime has become normal-time in America.” “Peacetime” stands thus in opposition to “wartime.” According to Dudizak, “built into the very essence of our idea of wartime is the assumption that war is temporary. But what happens when that is not the case? The sovereign power of the president is essentially grounded in the emergency linked to [this] state of war.”  During such states of war, “the metaphor of war becomes an integral part of the presidential political vocabulary whenever decisions considered to be of vital importance are being imposed.” 
War is essential for politics. In order to take action, and not end in a deadlock between politics, opposition, or opinion, the state of war becomes necessary. There are times – and there have been times in recent history – when a sovereign (president, prime minister, head of state) has made use of a so-called state of exception for this specific purpose. “Through the state of exception, the sovereign “creates and guarantees the situation” that the law needs for its own validity.”  But what is the state of exception? “The state of exception is […] a space devoid of law, a zone of anomie in which all legal determinations […] are deactivated.” It is brought on by an event of exception such as 9/11, or even the Covid pandemic for example, which leads to a situation where a government can – and, arguably, has to – take control. Often time sensitive, in these situations, it is a way to assure the ability of a government to act, and react in a situation appropriately and in a timely manner. Time and again, the beginning of a state of exception goes hand in hand with a state of war. Once a state of exception has been declared, what is a lot more difficult is its reversal.
Agamben tells us that “The voluntary creation of a permanent state of emergency (though perhaps not declared in the technical sense) has become one of the essential practices of contemporary states, including so-called democratic ones.”  The problem with such times of exceptions, or ‘wartime,’ as Mary Dudziak calls it, is that “wartime becomes a justification for a rule of law that bends in favor of the security of the state.”  It could be argued that this “justification for a rule of law that bends” is pertinent and necessary during such a time of war.   The problem however, when it comes to war time, and the state of exception, is that often, what is understood as the timeframe of war does not encompass the full timeframe a sovereign is awarded wartime powers. The example of Nazi Germany proves instructive, where “On February 28, [Hitler] proclaimed the Decree for the Protection of the People and the State which suspended the articles of the Weimar Constitution concerning personal liberties. The decree was never repealed, so that from a juridical standpoint the entire Third Reich can be considered a state of exception that lasted twelve years.”  Based on this, the ‘state of exception,’ and therefore arguably, the state of war, was not solely in place during the actual six years between 1939 and 1945 that most people associate with World War Two, but much longer than that. Usually, “this distortion has been tolerated because wars end. In the twenty-first century, however, we find ourselves in an era in which wartime – the war on terror – seems to have no endpoint.” 
This question has centered many of our discussions and entries throughout the semester. “How can we end a wartime when war doesn’t come to an end?”  In addition to this, Muñoz’s addressing of how “regimes of rigor” are deployed in defining, historicizing and categorizing the ‘endpoint’ of “war” has also kept us engaged in trying to respond to Muñoz's urgency by trying to “interrupt” this “dominant institutional ideology.” The randomized order of our shared object entries and the way they are stacked together on the homepage of Mundane Militarisms is one example of how we can critically begin to challenge “routinized understandings of proper evidence” of war.  
These questions and the argument of wartime ‘naturally’ being seen as a “state of exception” rather than as “form of time” is addressed through the seminar’s dedication to a critical description of these objects in a manner that questions the linearity of a static “past and present future.”  More concretely put, many of the militarized meanings/functions of these objects have been reinscribed with different uses across several everyday wars lasting up until the present day. Lee’s entry on “Monsanto Pesticides” is an example of how the description of these militarized objects are reinscribed with meaning in several different contexts spanning multiple decades that challenge the exceptionality of war in history-writing and demonstrate how the effects of wars lived multiple generations after their ‘ending’ are themselves actually part of this wartime. Lee demonstrates this by explaining how the movement of pesticides in both “private and public spaces highlights the arbitrariness and porousness of distinctions between wartime and peacetime and between domestic, agricultural and militarized demarcations of territory.”  Even through her structure of the entry, listing the different wars where pesticides were reinscribed with militarized meaning, like the Vietnam War and Plan Colombia, pushes against this mystification of wartime, demonstrating how these uses are not exceptional at all but actually deeply embedded in our everyday lives, an example being DDT wallpapers for children’s rooms in the 1940s. 
Our attempts at challenging what a ‘militarized object’ could mean and how everyday items took/continue to take on new meanings through militarism is an endeavor we have taken as a means to address the violence embedded in the “[routinizing] of war, specifically in how it is remembered, documented and archived.”  Many other examples were raised. Aika Sato, in her object entry on “The Politics of the ‘Comfort Women Statue’” illustrates how the act of focusing on the “extraordinary” allows for the construction of this “static archetype” of comfort women to erase the existing “residues of pain in survivors” under the guise of nationalist rhetoric.  Sato’s centering of survivor’s “highly subjective pain” and the call for comfort women to actually be in control of their own pasts puts history-writing into crisis, specifically its routinized manner of “conceal[ing], disguis[ing]” and “supress[ing] the everyday.”  Henry Zhang, in his object entry on “Straw Sandals”, thinks about the nation-state’s enduring role in history-writing in how the “allegorical content” of straw sandals has nearly been monopolized in attempts to concretize existing national myths across multiple governments. ‘Such sandals are a metonym for socialist zeal and parsimony, linked to the Long March (1934-1935)’ and yet nowadays, they can be found as ‘a stock picture […] on the Chinese retail site, Taobao.’ In Minh Huynh Vu’s contribution to our collective writing exercise, they explore the potential in thinking of the “formation” of mundane militarism through the “lens of memory.”  The intention of focusing on how the ‘mundane’ could be used as an “access point” for histories that have been “actively forgotten by top-down definitions of militarism from governments, textbooks, and policies that privilege whiteness, English and masculinity.” In doing this, Huynh Vu is showing how we can interrupt routinized manners of history-writing and simultaneously delegitimize the ‘objective’ “dominant institutional ideology.”  
In their object entry, Huynh Vu concretizes this even further. They think of cardboard boxes that were converted into ‘cardboard cribs’ in Vietnam during the “Operation Babylift.”  Here, “babies are […] prepped, packaged, shipped, and delivered - a makeshift warehouse of industrial intimacies.”  Such same cardboard boxes, this time containing “Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) lunchboxes,’ were ‘airdropped to soldiers starting in 1961.”  While the boxes did provide the soldiers with nutrition, they were barely satisfactory. “The caloric and nutritional extent of the lunchboxes are constructed based upon a minimum, similar to how the cardboard cribs were allocated a particular amount of baby formula, diapers, and blankets.”  The main criteria for the food was ‘“acceptability,”’ ‘the boxes must simply be edible so that the soldiers can continue their military conduct, ’ while the food itself however, was ‘“uniformly awful.”  The cardboard boxes, whether ‘paradoxical sites of tender torture,’ or as a simple means to an end, focusing on ‘“subsistence” - as opposed to “sustenance”’ represent the very essence of how the most mundane objects can bear the traces of past militarisms.  Sato’s freewrite response speaks to this supposed ‘objectivity,'' specifically how the binary of a “victim/perpetrator identity'' entertains this “ institutional ideology” and in the process of reducing the everyday to this binary, is participating in the violent attempt at “fixing meaning” through this illusion of a ‘shared’ ‘objective past.  
While delegitimizing this belief in ‘objectivity’ within history-writing, our object entries actively function as mediums through which the idea of wartime is “demystif[ied].”  An example of this could be seen with Siri Lee’s entry “Yank’s Magic Carpet” consisting of a critical description of a souvenir booklet that was made for U.S. personnel in China, Burma and India in 1945. Lee is “demystifying” wartime and its exceptionality by detailing how the language used in this booklet maps out a U.S. soldier's experience overseas as if it was a “tourist and fairytale experience rather than a military one.”  Through this entry, Lee makes clear how Yank, the Army Weekly, was using these booklets in attempts to illustrate the military experience through a “touristic filtering.”  
In terms of “war trauma and reconciliation,” Aika Sato expands on this in our shared freewrite response and thinks about the actors of reconciliations and its purpose. Sato follows this by explaining how “war trauma and lingering animosity does not fit into a linear, teleological narrative,” and simultaneously contributing to this demystification of wartime through the direct criticism of how ‘reconciliation’ most often than not does not center those who are reliving these wars everyday.  Sato, through her freewrite is also putting into question this linearity of wartime, arguing that this clear before and after, with reconciliation following an ‘after’ is deeply problematic in how it creates a “single master narrative” and the belief of a “resolution of closure” that immediately absolves governments of their active roles in the continuation of war, echoing both Agamben and Dudziak. 
Wartime then, is not as simple as just the beginning and ending of a conflict. War does not end once ‘a treaty is signed’  Based on a writing exercise we did to prepare for this essay, co-written between 10 people, the lingering effects between war and its past into the current present on a more personal level have also become strikingly clear. Maeva O’Brien wrote about her grandfather who “was a boy in Tokyo during WWII, and his memories of it are suffused with fire, violence, and starvation.”  These resounding memories guided O’Brien when growing up, ‘and it taught [her] a number of values: the importance of education, the fragility and power of historiography, the disaster of war, the dangers of empire and nationalism.’ Aika Sato wrote about her own experience as someone ‘born to a Japanese father and a Chinese mother, [she]grew up in both countries, witnessing the past haunting the present […] : [her] Chinese classmates called [her] a “little Japanese” and all turned around staring at [her], as if [she] were the enemy that the teacher was passionately and indignantly uttering about during a history class on the Nanjing Massacre.’ 
Alex Whee Kim wrote about how the disappearance of his great-great-grandfather still impacts his family today, with an “empty myo – a figure of absence to embed a multigenerational reminder of [their] filial impiety […] until restitution is made.” All of these examples suggest that even once a war has ended on paper (all of these examples speak of the effects of World War II), the remnants continue to have an impact for generations to come. This is what Marianne Hirsch calls postmemory, ‘distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection.”  It “characterizes the experience of those who grow up dominated by narratives that receded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated.”  Michael Rothberg takes this idea further, stating that ‘postmemory may well constitute a particular version of memory’s multidirectionality.’ In his Multidirectional Memory, Rothberg “emphasiz[es] that coming to terms with the past always happens in comparative contexts and via the circulation of memories linked to what are only apparently separate histories and national or ethnic constituencies.”  Such “separate histories” are apparent in the object stories, discussions and collective writing exercises we have done throughout this class, where modern retail sites clash with 1940s sandals; cardboard boxes come together with Vietnam war time cribs; and ancestors influence future generations for years to come.

AII. What are mundane militarisms?: The study of encountering and working through the limitations and impossibilities of the archives

Encountering Archival Failures
What is there to do when the archive yields no testimony—or worse, when it reveals only “lowly lives reduced to ashes in the few phrases that have destroyed them”? This is Foucault’s question in “The Life of Infamous Men,” and Saidiya Hartman echoes it in her lamentation for an enslaved woman named Venus: “no one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or observed that she refused to say anything at all. Hers is an untimely story told by a failed witness… The archive is, in this case, a death sentence, a tomb, a display of the violated body, an inventory of property, a medical treatise on gonorrhea, a few lines about a whore’s life, an asterisk in the grand narrative of history.”
The less legible Venus becomes, the greater Hartman’s desire to resuscitate her—prompting Stephen Best, in a recent polemic, to compare Hartman and other scholars of Black and Ethnic Studies to forensics specialists, trying, through diligent archival digging, to return to the scene of the crime: “The vanished world of the black Atlantic comes into existence through loss and can be sustained only through more tales of its loss. To frame history in this way preserves faith in the lost object as a counterpoint to the past’s irrevocability.” 
To turn from the afterlives of transatlantic slavery to mundane militarisms, one faces similar questions. A twofold problem arises: that of frameworks and that of evidence. Crystal Baik seems to share a similar anxiety to Best’s when she discusses the shortcomings of “trauma-based concepts such as intergenerational hauntings and postmemory,” and advocates, instead, for an analysis of “the morphing conditions and causal effects that continuously transfigure militarized subjects, spaces, and phenomena into seen yet illegible manifestations of war in the first place.” Such concerns seem to dovetail with Mary Dudziak, who argues against a conceptualization of war as exceptional, as a page break between the prose of ordinary life; she argues for treating it as a mood, a set of expectations and habits that affects.	
The second question is what a more “mundane” archive might look like. War, Harry Harootunian suggests, might be best explained not by letters between heads of state, but as the oral account of a bar hostess—provided her words can be documented. Such a casual, vernacular exchange forms part of what Harootunian calls a “turn to the everyday.” Harootunian makes the Benjaminian point that photographs and films are able to “historicize” our present, to juxtapose it with a set of pasts, like a collage. Many of the scholars we read this semester seem to share Harutoonian’s belief in the potential of photography and film. 
Laura Wexler, for example, explores the 19th century, American deployment of domestic sentiment as instrument for imperial consolidation in the Philippines, through the photographs of Frances Benjamin Johnston; what “prevents [American troops stationed in the Philippines] from being arsonists, rapists, looters, lynchers” is that they are “mama’s boys”; by critically parsing the “state of the album,” we might expose this prototypical version of purplewashing.
Thy Phu, however, notes that wartime photography, too, is often spectacularized—it is the Vietnam Triptych, seared into the American popular imaginary, that best captures the wartime sublime, which, as in Kant’s reckoning, is occasioned by, not inherent in, the objects that we see; in other words, Euro-American fascination with Vietnamese pain is, ultimately, a narcissistic opportunity for Westerners to be awed by their own own capacity for sympathy and pity. 
Like Phu, the Hartman of Scenes of Subjection turns away from the scene of Aunt Hester’s whipping in The Narrative of Frederick Douglass, arguing that readers’ fascination with such a scene is a similarly lurid, self-absorbed attempt to consume black pain. Indeed, this is a concern that Aika shares, with regard to survivors of sexual slavery under Japanese empire, for whom the very act of testimony might be retraumatizing. In seeming tension with her concerns in “Venus,” here Hartman prefers to explore more muted examples of black subjectivization, just as Phu, for her part, wants to shift focus onto the “quotidian rites of family photography, the sentimentality of landscape, and the glossy slickness of tourism.”
Jose Esteban Muñoz provides another critique both of archives and interpretive frameworks when he highlights the relational aspect that situates objects and performances in a social context; arguing against the fetishization of academic rigor, for “durable” archives,  Muñoz claims kinship with such “passing intellectual fancies” as ethnic, feminist, and queer studies; its love of “innuendo, gossip, and fleeting moments.” Here, ephemerality serves as a kind of protection for minoritarian, queer subjects, allowing interaction with “those within its epistemological sphere—while evaporating at the touch of those who would eliminate queer possibility.” But as with the bar hostess (more ephemeral) account, Muñoz’s example of a Tony Just performance of sanitizing “a tea room where public sex takes place” is still documented with “a series of photographs”; how, we wondered, as we embarked on our object stories, could we write about something “undocumented”? Is the ephemera that evaporates from hostile, queerphobic subjects somehow jeopardized when we meditate on it using a durable medium like writing?
		
Engaging Archival Failures
We engaged these archival limitations as apertures, not aporias—moments of collective epistemological reflexivity, the constant readjusting of our readerly practices in the collective study of mundane militarisms. The mundane, as a temporal and affective analytic, prohibits the disciplinary habit of “[v]iewing war as an exception to normal life” in “changing society and creating particular conditions of governance.” As José Esteban Muñoz elaborates, these conditions of governance facilitate the “the systematic erasure of minoritarian histories” under “officially subsidized and substantiated institutions” that privilege solidity and visibility as indexical parameters of what is (not) deemed an archive. Therefore, Muñoz poses ephemera as an “archive of queerness” that adumbrates, but does not absorb, minoritarian histories which manifest as “invisible evidence” that evades institutional codification, collation, and commodification. Ariella Azoulay describes the minor but significant technology of the paperclip, “the simple accessory with which one attaches the [archival] referent” and “facilitates its sorting and categorization”—the collection name, the call number, and the finding aid which all structure how we encounter and engage the archive.
In our engagement with mundane militarisms, we not only imagine what it would mean to remove the paperclip from an existing archive, but also what it would mean to work through alternative archives that cannot be paperclipped in the first place. Through syllabus readings, conversations with visiting scholars, and our own writings, we grappled with the limitations—even impossibilities—of producing indexical and intelligible archives when engaging war as a mundane structure. Some of the mundane archival alternatives we encountered include the expendable, such as the orphaned images of Southern Vietnamese families in Thy Phu’s Warring Visions; the embodied, such as the dermatological diseases manufactured by U.S. scientists and government officials during the War in Vietnam in Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu’s Experiments in Skin; and the environmental, such as the colonial landscapes in Caren Kaplan, Gabi Kirk, and Tess Lea’s Everyday Militarisms. Within our own ongoing attempt in curating a digital archive of mundane militarisms, our “historical texts” included disregarded, disposed, and decomposed objects, including but not limited to canned meats, cardboard boxes, and Kodachrome color slides.
If mundane militarisms evert and expand the standard scope of the institutional archive and what counts as evidence once war is no longer “only the province of historians,” such is also the case with our methodological practices and disciplinary training. As Ann Stoler succinctly explains, “scholars should view archives not as sites of knowledge retrieval, but of knowledge production.” Understanding the archive as a process—not product—facilitates the symbiotic epistemological transformation of “unlearning imperialism” and its tradition that “presumes people and worlds as raw materials” in order to pursue a “practice of potential history” as a “mode of being with others differently.”
A collaboratory experiment in “being with others differently” as gestures towards histories that are simply and merely potential—that is, not fully actualized given the risk of reification, overdetermination, and institutionalization—our seminar and online exhibit operate through the “capacities of the subjunctive” rather than the indicative by “straining against the limits of the archive” in narrating what could have been rather than what is or what was. Throughout the semester, we had the opportunity to learn with and from a slate of generous scholars who offered academic and personal reflections on their ongoing struggles with the archive and its limitations, a relationship that is further complicated by their subject positions within the university. Laura Wexler politicizes “archives as an index of accountability,” a measure through which one is “seeing like a state” in the study of family photograph albums. Wambui Mwangi incisively distinguishes the durational and therefore aesthetic differences between “looking” and “seeing” in the quotidian circulation and reproduction of currency in Colonial Kenya. Diana Taylor destabilizes the “particular event” of war through performative “theater models” of reenactments, rehearsals, and recitations that dramatize the protracted and recursive process of militarism. Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu “access[es] archives of skin” in the chemical afterlife of the War in Vietnam not as epidermal evidence of imperial violence, but as a “record of our collective imbrication” and how “history becomes embodied” for Vietnamese women in their relational practices among and against contamination. 
Evident across these four disciplinarily different yet methodologically similar scholarly orientations around everyday archives is a shared reckoning with the very notion of evidence and its analytical failures. A study of mundane militarisms—as Wexler, Mwangi, Taylor, Nguyen Tu, and others demonstrate—necessitates a non-disciplinary and non-extractive archival practice of vulnerable relationality. Attuning to the mundane requires relinquishing the compulsion for scholarly detachment and objective analysis., and instead acceding to the analytical and affective uncertainties of the everyday through implication, imbrication, inhabitation into the very objects that continue to constitute our everyday environments. Encountering these archival limitations, our experiment of, with, and through mundane militarisms was not catalyzed by a desire to coin a new theory of empire, but to linger within its plurality by confronting and confounding national narratives and their binarized logics of victory/defeat, peace/conflict, combatant/non-combatant, alive/dead, domestic/foreign, and so on.

Experimenting Archival Failures
Over this semester, each of us wrote two stories on the militarized objects that we encounter in the realm of everyday. In doing so, the goal is to critically rethink the relationship between subject and object; it is less about the mundanity of the object at issue itself, but more about the everyday relationship with the object. 
The conventional approach to war in the disciplines of social sciences has been largely embedded in a masculinist and state-centric tradition derived from and intimately linked to a colonial European modernity discourse that puts emphasis on rationality and objectivity. By turning to humanist methodologies, our effort in engaging and writing object stories is to resist the so-called seductive “objective” claim of knowledge, and to gesture towards anti-rigor, feminist, anti-imperial, and anti-colonial futures. The digital archive that presents our object stories is a workspace of compassion and creativity that encourages everyone to think together alternative ways of “knowing” that deviate from hegemonies of knowledge production. 
More specifically, the mode of attention to the everyday has introduced a major shift in our way of “encountering” the way in which militarism is spilled over, is inherited by, and is dispersed through the time of the present. Turning to the ordinary not only helps us to locate the phantoms of the past in the lived particularities, but also offers us an alternative language of sensorial engagement in “sensing” the banal and ephemeral as the legacies of the past. Through her work on sexual assault victims in India during the Partition of 1947 and the massacre of Sikhs in 1984, Veena Das points out how often we have suspicion toward the “ordinary,” which “demands a repeated attention to the most ordinary of objects and events.” She argues that we are often driven by a “theoretical impulse” to “escape the ordinary rather than a descent into it” and to impose a preconceived meta-assumption onto the object of our research, rather than inviting theories to come out of the mundanity. Das, and many other scholars, whose works have challenged our preconceptions to redefine and expand the narratives of militarism by paying attention to the minute gesture, the physiognomy of verbal accounts, and unnoticed fragments unfolded into the present. With a special attention to details and allowing the mundanity to exist without resisting “the desire to fill in the narrative gaps and close the loopholes,” the unspeakable can be powerfully present and strongly felt which may traverse generations, modes of verbal, visual, affective expression.” In a similar vein, José Esteban Muñoz also calls the way conventional academic rigidity approaches evidence into question, challenging the regime of what he refers to as “rigor” that is “owned, made, and deployed through institutional ideology.” In his sense, ephemera does not disappear but gives rise to a modality of “anti-evidence” and “anti-rigor”—a regime that offers an alternative interpretation of materiality that includes “traces, glimmers, residues, and specks of things” that are not always solid, tangible, and verbal. 
Perhaps some examples from part of our object stories might be warranted. The choices of objects vary. Some choose the objects that are present in our everyday lives, but either we barely notice or we are oblivious to the meanings beneath the objects at issue. For example, Sunny’s story on the Japanese friendship bridge shows how this particular bridge is a node of multilayered symbolic and physical representation of militarism, which speaks to personal, local, and geostrategic significance. Similarly, Jessica demonstrates how Kodachrome color slide shows, while being the iconic turning point to the field of chemical development, were  entrenched in war and nuclearism. Cathy’s elaboration on a wooden cart that has been in her grandmother’s basement for the past 75 years also casts doubt on how much we have truly seen. The cart is a “visual representation of the danger and despair many must have felt” when fleeing the war; Cathy argues that the affects—the fear and despair—associated with the usage of this cart are largely forgotten. This particular object evokes our discussion on Kaplan’s work, Aerial Aftermaths, in which she sheds light on how some photographers like Ristelhueber strive to capture the “stillness of near artifacts” that could not only show the crazed flight of fighters, but also how the separation of object and the owner could possibly transform the possession into a form of abstraction devoid of meanings. Maeva, similarly, turns to a transpacific cinematic popular icon, Godzilla, that reveals the “reverberations of nuclearism in popular culture” that is “beyond the explicit purview of state and military apparatuses.” 
Tracing the historical genealogy of their objects, Henry and Jess explore how certain objects are co-opted into the construction of “we-ness” for particular political goals. Henry traces the history of straw sandals in China, finding out how it has been instrumentalized into the national myth-making and how the meaning has been reinvented in the public narratives of the Red Army and the current regime leadership. Jess traces donation cards distributed among the Cuban community in the U.S. to support Anti-Casto terrorist organizations. She highlights not only the function of the donation cards, but also their role as expected “moral payments” for everyday Cuban exiles living in America as both affirmation of their "Cubaness" and political commitment of liberation of their homeland. Jess argues that the formal halting of U.S. support allows the continuity of violence, an abnegationfor any responsibility of the infliction of terror caused by these organizations that were, in fact, heavily trained by the U.S..
Alex’s story on Earthball shows how militarism is reenacted into public games. It does lead to the question of where exactly the boundary lies between simulation of war and militaristic reality. The term “reenactment” seems to assume it is possible to restore the impossible—that is the totality of war and militarism, including the scale, affect, loss, minuscule details of tragedies entailed by militarism. As Taylor rightfully argues, “[w]e mine the past more for affect than for knowledge”; reenactment is less about the complete and truthful reproduction of the past. It is perhaps more about reproducing the sense of nostalgia we have for a particular romanticized past that we selectively choose to believe. 
Some other object stories are attempts to include the ephemeral, the absent, the silenced, and the unspeakable into the Mundane Militarisms archive. For example, Henry’s story on the scarecrow in the context of the currently ongoing pandemic measure in Shanghai points us to the question of how to practice a “Foucauldian suspicion of archives” when archival solidity is, to a certain degree, unattainable. Minh’s story on cardboard boxes produced during the Vietnam War presents us another hidden layer of official logistic preparation that is preoccupied with economical subsistence, as opposed to “sustenance.” Minh points us to a “larger epistemological quandary on how to study historical material that is (although discarded) still leftover, still lingering.” Aika, meanwhile, has been frantically looking for the voices of rape victims by the U.S. military personnel in Okinawa, but to no avail. In order to capture that silence in the digital archives, she shows how the victim's deafening silence has, nevertheless, been haunting the present—quietly yet powerfully mobilizing the political clashes and affective surge in Okinawa, the Japanese mainland, the U.S., and larger geopolitics.

	While this essay and the seminar course from which it has emerged engage with collaborative practice as a means of interrogating and disentangling the imbrication of our own intellectual labor with the militarized legacies (and presents) of academia, we must also acknowledge that the practice of collaboration is not inherently a direct corrective for militarism. Collaboration itself, particularly in the sphere of academia, is one of the characteristic features of the military-industrial-academic complex. Indeed, this powerful nexus to which President Dwight D. Eisenhower referred in his parting warning to the American public was a vibrant space of collaboration, breaking disciplinary and institutional boundaries to develop, compute, and solve the complex problems of Cold War defense technology and administration.
	The notion of the military-industrial-academic complex tends to conjure visions of strict militaristic management and cloistered laboratory workers surrounded by the sterile, homogenous environment of IBM computer rooms. This cultural imaginary was reflected in the countercultural scene of the 1960s: as John Harwood recounts, university students involved in antiwar protests and the Free Speech Movement “publicly burned the IBM punch cards containing their registration information in protest against ‘the Machine.’” However, the actual social culture within these networks of universities, military think tanks, and industrial corporations was hardly the kind of machinic technobureaucracy popularly imagined at the time. The complex and interdisciplinary nature of computational technologies so heavily employed in the so-called Machine resulted in a novel laboratory and scholarly culture that brought together a diverse array of disciplines under a shared, collaborative language. Fred Turner describes one such environment, MIT’s Rad Lab, one of the major partners in the Cold War military apparatus:
The pressures to produce new technologies to fight the war drove formerly specialized scientists and engineers to cross professional boundaries, to routinely mix work with pleasure, and to form new, interdisciplinary networks within which to work and live… [These professionals] developed ‘contact languages’… [and] shared tools… to demonstrate concepts across disciplinary boundaries or serve as sites for collaborative work.
This contact language would ultimately become formalized as its own discipline: cybernetics, which would continue to stimulate intense interdisciplinary collaborations throughout post-war culture.
	This intermingling of collaborative pleasure and military work was present across the laboratory geography of the Cold War, which was on full display in the 1959 LIFE photoessay of the RAND Corporation, a prominent military think tank based in Santa Monica, California. Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi narrates one especially striking photograph in the feature of a group of young RAND analysts lounging after-hours on the floor of director Albert Wohlstetter’s domestic study: “This is the mise en scene for the modern intellectual: along with futuristic chairs and a Japanese paper kite dangling from the ceiling, the image highlights the conspicuous informality of lolling on the floor while debating the life and death of the nation.” In RAND’s own reportage and work produced in the same period, the collusion of playful collaboration and military strategy is apparent again. Wargaming was a famously popular mode of work for RAND, and additional unpublished photography taken by Leonard McCombe for LIFE depicts analysts playing chess tournaments or lounging together in the RAND complex courtyards for lunch. This milieu extends, as Pamela M. Lee notes, to RAND’s mission statement and public documents, which heavily mobilized “the language of diversity and creativity” as well, identifying “the think tank [as] a social organism, with an ambience of bonhomie and humor.”
	This loose-tied, collective spirit of RAND finds a surprising parallel in the very countercultural movements intended to oppose and resist its managerial vision of military administration. In one such site of resistance, The New Games Movement, the project was not to do away with the ludic, collaborative creativity of RAND or MIT, but instead to reprogram the games in which such creativity was organized. As Stewart Brand, one of the organizers of the first New Games events wrote in an essay titled “Theory of Game Change” (a likely play on RAND’s ‘game theory’):
You can’t change a game by winning it, goes the formula… You change a game by leaving it, going somewhere else, and starting a new game. If it works, it will in time alter or replace the old game.
The New Games organizers devised a series of games that both satirized the competitive world-making projects of the Cold War powers and used these experimental games as a means of exploring new, communal, more collaborative modes of relating, working, and living with one another. Even here in the space of countercultural utopianism, militarism pervaded the material culture of the New Games. One of Brand’s most notable inventions, Earthball, involved “a six-foot diameter canvas and rubber pushball of the type [Brand] had played with in Army boot camp training,” and another, The Parachute Games, was likely inspired by Brand’s parachutist training in the Army Rangers. Nevertheless, the New Games organizers clearly believed these loaded objects could be subverted. “I felt that by reexamining the basic idea of play, we could [organize] a joyous recreation experience that creates a sense of community and personal expression,” Pat Farrington, one of the New Games Foundation’s directors, said of these first New Games Tournaments. “People could center on the joy of playing, cooperating, and trusting, rather than striving to win.”
	The epilogue of the New Games Movement tells a different story. As Turner demonstrates in his robust examination of the legacies of countercultural figures like Brand, the utopian communalism of the New Games Movement would be directly succeeded by the libertarian entrepreneurialism of the technology industry. This, Turner argues, was not a recuperation of a radical movement into the neoliberal order, but rather a retroactive indication of the uneven distribution of freedom and mobility within the countercultural “Back-to-the-Land” movement with which the New Games Movement and Brand were associated. The consumer technology that bloomed in subsequent years fused the Movement’s freely-associating communality with an idealized libertarian, elite citizenry: a “freelance lifestyle of a high-profile consultant as a model of the independent lifestyle ostensibly becoming available to the digital generation as a whole.” The question then has always already been: who gets to collaborate?
	This is not to say that a radical practice of collaboration is irredeemably intertwined with an ideology of militarism or neoliberal capitalism. As Lee writes, “We won’t and can’t throw out the baby with the Cold War bathwater.” But a collaborative practice that aims to engage the difficult work of unlearning “our collective inheritance of [militaristic] tendencies” must ask how to build forms of scholarly and writerly collaboration that, in and of themselves, actively disentangle and counteract their deep histories of militarism and potential complicities within the neoliberal present.

​​Academic Collaboration as Resistance: The Possibilities of Critical Pedagogy
Against a history of militarized collaboration, we might look for an alternative tradition in the field of critical pedagogy. Critical pedagogy starts from the claim that the kinds of study and work taking place in modern, Western educational institutions tend to reproduce asymmetrical relations of power based on specific race, class, and gender dynamics. Rather than framing schools as sites of social and economic mobility, critical pedagogy first sees academic institutions embedded in historically oppressive social and political regimes; from this perspective, the relation between academic institutions and state or military power can be made not only visible but furthermore the focal point for concentrated practices of resistance. Critical pedagogy attunes itself to ways in which educational institutions normalize and legitimize existing social practices, and then it imagines alternative norms and models of education that might enable social transformation and freedom.
To the extent that critical pedagogy may be traced to a single point of origin, that point is probably the work of Paulo Freire, a Brazilian teacher and philosopher. In Freire’s most famous work, Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), he describes the traditional “banking concept of education,” wherein “students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor. Instead of communicating, the teacher issues communiqués and makes deposits that the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat.” As an alternative, Freire advocates “problem-posing education,” in which “people develop their power to perceive critically the way they exist in the world with which and in which they find themselves; they come to see the world not as a static reality, but as a reality in process, in transformation.” Problem-posing education emphasizes learning for emancipation rather than for economic participation, and it requires teachers to understand themselves in relation to students. Following Freire’s central tenet of educational praxis, teachers and students work together to understand the real problems shaping their lives, to devise and test possible solutions, and then to evaluate their work to restart the cycle of inquiry and action. Students and teachers alike are understood as historical agents constantly responding to and acting upon a dynamic social world.
Critical pedagogy since Freire has taken numerous and varied routes, a selection of which we’ll outline here as discursive partners and models for the project of our course and this paper. Freire’s student Antónia Darder has spent her career advocating education within an “emancipatory spirit of hope” by which “teachers and students move in solidarity across the terrain of cultural differences” to discover the “many ways to be human.” In particular, she recommends “commonplace materials and natural environments” as the ground for academic work, wherein if scholars “courageously abandon old and disempowering notions of what is necessary and certain” they might “investigate the ordinary, and through acting on it discover their potential power to create and change the world.” Henry Giroux, a key founder of critical pedagogy in the American context, emphasizes the importance of critical theory in education, arguing in particular that education grounded in critical theory grants scholars a radical view of knowledge. When relations of domination and subordination come into view as the frame through which intellectual content is distilled in academic contexts, more radical content and forms of knowledge become both more accessible and more desirable. In a related vein, Giroux advocates sensual and imaginative modes of knowledge in academic settings, in addition to more traditionally cognitive modes.
The above thinkers typically take K-12 education as their context, but thinkers including bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Stefano Harney, and Fred Moten, all of whom also participate in the scholarly tradition of radical black feminism, have brought similar methods and perspectives to the realm of higher education. hooks imagined the university classroom as a “communal place” that “remains the most radical space of possibility in the academy.” She developed a practice of “engaged pedagogy,” requiring teachers to bring their fullest and most spiritually, emotionally, and physically well selves into the classroom in order to invite the same of their students; only by allowing deeply emotional, human responses in the classroom, she argued, could teachers honor the diversity of students’ lives and truly “transgress” oppressive systems. Lorde also promoted community based on difference as essential to radical academic work, both for those who easily identified within the academy and for those who didn’t. “Difference is that raw and powerful connection from which our personal power is forged,” she argued to the 1983 New York University Institute for the Humanities, and
Those of us who stand outside the circle of [social acceptance] know that survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to stand alone, unpopular and sometimes reviled, and how to make common cause with those others identified as outside the structures in order to define and seek a world in which we can all flourish. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support.
While Freire, Darder, and Giroux mold our sense for the content of academic practices that seek to resist through community, hooks and Lorde here emphasize ways in which such practices themselves serve as potential means of care and strength for their practitioners. That is, of course, not to say that such values arise immediately or inherently in spaces of academic collaboration, even those aspiring to follow the tenets of critical pedagogy: the works of both hooks and Lorde attend extensively to the kinds of normalized harm that occur regularly in well-meaning academic spaces, which at minimum seem to always rest on a precarious edge of institutionalized oppression and harmful social reproduction.
Furthering this sense for the inherent hostility of the university and suggesting a more absolute limit to the notion of resistance through academic collaboration, Harney and Moten argue that American universities today are places of “refuge” but not “enlightenment” for “subversive intellectual[s],” and thus “the only possible relationship to the university today is a criminal one.” While Moten and Harney look to “the beyond of teaching,” or its “prophecy,” i.e. the community that can occur among subversive thinkers and engender social rupture, as “not finishing oneself, not passing, not completing; [but] allowing subjectivity to be unlawfully overcome by others” until one exceeds or abandons subjecthood and thus also subjection, they also understand classroom teaching—which might reasonably be said to include the work of all participants in a graduate seminar such as ours—as required, extractive, and necessarily objectifying. They therefore insist that truly free and uncorrupted thinking is impossible within the authorized structures of the university, and that such structures erase the labor and emancipatory possibilities of an academic lower class (“Maroon communities of composition teachers, mentorless graduate students, adjunct Marxist historians, out or queer management professors […]”) that makes the university possible. Critical pedagogy, to Moten and Harney, is only an effort to “perfect professional education” within a rapacious and totalizing neoliberal regime, and thus it is complicit in the systems of oppression and exploitation it claims to dispute.

Our Practices of Academic Collaboration
        	Without disputing Moten and Harney’s analysis and in recognition of our shared place within the university they so describe, we have nevertheless pursued ways in which to use our course and this paper to test alternative, critical modes of study and collaboration. Like ourselves, the eleven co-authors of “For Slow Scholarship: A Feminist Politics of Resistance through Collective Action in the Neoliberal University” (2015) self-consciously hold advantaged positions within the university system, and from there they describe their collective essay as a means by which they “moved together from the isolating effects of the work conditions [of a neoliberal university] to a more collective form of response and action” and as “[their] version of refusal, [their] attempt to act in-against-and-beyond the university.” Our work on this essay has proceeded with similar aspirations, entailing discussions throughout the semester about the principles and political potential of academic collaboration, shared prewriting, collaborative essay conceptualization and outlining, and a distribution of the drafting process among subgroups of the course community. The experience has exposed us to the particular challenges and opportunities of collaborative writing. This writer found the work of devising common, coherent arguments challenging given the limited time frame of a semester (in line with Mountz et al’s criticism of “a work rhythm that is rushed, riddled with anxiety and pressure to be ever-present” in today’s universities), but felt the effort offered a meaningful opportunity to make shared sense of a varied and thought-provoking semester. The common final product is in the spirit of the collaborative process (un)learning we’ve undertaken over thirteen weeks of study.
	Regular writing with each other as our audience has been a routine feature of our course and helped build our common foundation. Our weekly “keyword” responses offered opportunities to propose and explore innovative approaches to or critiques of the study of historical militarism. Class sessions typically started with Sunny’s generative synthesis and probing questions based on the responses, and in discussion we commonly cited each other’s work. Our Mundane Militarisms archive was also built with ourselves as the starting audience, and again our conversations about the archive structure and individual entries drew together and hybridized our work. While such examples might suggest practices that are common across graduate seminars in the humanities, this writer found that collaboration and mutual intellectual exchange were achieved to an unusually high degree. Our readings and discussions about method; Sunny’s example and mentorship; her “less is more” approach to a reading load narrowed assignments to prioritize richer, deeper engagement; and each student’s individual commitment to the collaborative ethos of the class are all at least partially responsible for the successes we had in this regard.
	Our readings and frequent conversations with scholars outside our university also engendered our spirit of collaboration and our understanding of and sensitivity to alternate modes of scholarship and knowledge production. In line with the Freirean model of educational praxis, we spoke with Laura Wexler, Caren Kaplan, Gabi Kirk, Alvita Akiboh, Thuy Linh Tu, Maile Arvin, and Crystal Baik about their own practices of research and collaboration, with specific attention to the challenges they face as academics attempting work at various disciplinary and methodological frontiers. Our readings, including those from the scholars to whom we spoke, modeled radical approaches to knowledge that generally put authority in the ‘mundane’ experiences of ‘everyday’ people on the peripheries or in the lower strata of empire, often those historically overlooked by institutionalized approaches to history and warfare.
