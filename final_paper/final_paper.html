                      AI: What are mundane militarisms?: The study of unlearning traditional and institutional histories and disciplinary methods

                      The “surplus of everyday life,” with its “staggering complexities, “messy residues,” “untidiness,” complexities, “repetitions” and “endless incompletion” have all been just some of the theoretical frameworks that our semester-long seminar has engaged with in our attempts to demonstrate the interconnectedness between what we consider to be mundane and the meanings of war. Through the collection of object entries our seminar has compiled on Mundane Militarisms, our shared keyword definitions and class notes, and in our conversations with scholars across multiple disciplines every week, we have been answering the question of what constitutes war against the long-lasting conventions of history-writing, or what Muñoz describes as the “regime of rigor. ”  Thinking with Hartoonian and Muñoz, these expectations of history-writing, that in turn legitimize “regimes of rigor,” are founded upon the constant displacement of the “danger posed by the surplus of everyday life.” 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      One example through which this obsession with “finding an encompassing register that will fix meaning” is manifested is the urge to periodize and/or linearize the spectacular or exceptional to strictly maintain the binary between “peacetime” and “wartime” as mentioned by Dudziak.  And yet, what is ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’? “The beginning of war is the opening of an era that will, by definition, come to an end.”  Yet, “when we look at the full timeline of American military conflicts, including the “small wars” and the so-called forgotten wars, there are not many years of peacetime. This shows us that war is not an exception to normal peacetime, but instead an enduring condition.”  This theorization carries concerning consequences. “If we abandon the idea that war is confined in time we can see more clearly that our law and politics are not suspended by an exception to the regular order of things. Instead, wartime has become normal-time in America.” “Peacetime” stands thus in opposition to “wartime.” According to Dudizak, “built into the very essence of our idea of wartime is the assumption that war is temporary. But what happens when that is not the case? The sovereign power of the president is essentially grounded in the emergency linked to [this] state of war.”  During such states of war, “the metaphor of war becomes an integral part of the presidential political vocabulary whenever decisions considered to be of vital importance are being imposed.”

                  <p>
                      War is essential for politics. In order to take action, and not end in a deadlock between politics, opposition, or opinion, the state of war becomes necessary. There are times – and there have been times in recent history – when a sovereign (president, prime minister, head of state) has made use of a so-called state of exception for this specific purpose. “Through the state of exception, the sovereign “creates and guarantees the situation” that the law needs for its own validity.”  But what is the state of exception? “The state of exception is […] a space devoid of law, a zone of anomie in which all legal determinations […] are deactivated.” It is brought on by an event of exception such as 9/11, or even the Covid pandemic for example, which leads to a situation where a government can – and, arguably, has to – take control. Often time sensitive, in these situations, it is a way to assure the ability of a government to act, and react in a situation appropriately and in a timely manner. Time and again, the beginning of a state of exception goes hand in hand with a state of war. Once a state of exception has been declared, what is a lot more difficult is its reversal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Agamben tells us that “The voluntary creation of a permanent state of emergency (though perhaps not declared in the technical sense) has become one of the essential practices of contemporary states, including so-called democratic ones.”  The problem with such times of exceptions, or ‘wartime,’ as Mary Dudziak calls it, is that “wartime becomes a justification for a rule of law that bends in favor of the security of the state.”  It could be argued that this “justification for a rule of law that bends” is pertinent and necessary during such a time of war.   The problem however, when it comes to war time, and the state of exception, is that often, what is understood as the timeframe of war does not encompass the full timeframe a sovereign is awarded wartime powers. The example of Nazi Germany proves instructive, where “On February 28, [Hitler] proclaimed the Decree for the Protection of the People and the State which suspended the articles of the Weimar Constitution concerning personal liberties. The decree was never repealed, so that from a juridical standpoint the entire Third Reich can be considered a state of exception that lasted twelve years.”  Based on this, the ‘state of exception,’ and therefore arguably, the state of war, was not solely in place during the actual six years between 1939 and 1945 that most people associate with World War Two, but much longer than that. Usually, “this distortion has been tolerated because wars end. In the twenty-first century, however, we find ourselves in an era in which wartime – the war on terror – seems to have no endpoint.”

                      This question has centered many of our discussions and entries throughout the semester. “How can we end a wartime when war doesn’t come to an end?”  In addition to this, Muñoz’s addressing of how “regimes of rigor” are deployed in defining, historicizing and categorizing the ‘endpoint’ of “war” has also kept us engaged in trying to respond to Muñoz's urgency by trying to “interrupt” this “dominant institutional ideology.” The randomized order of our shared object entries and the way they are stacked together on the homepage of Mundane Militarisms is one example of how we can critically begin to challenge “routinized understandings of proper evidence” of war.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      These questions and the argument of wartime ‘naturally’ being seen as a “state of exception” rather than as “form of time” is addressed through the seminar’s dedication to a critical description of these objects in a manner that questions the linearity of a static “past and present future.”  More concretely put, many of the militarized meanings/functions of these objects have been reinscribed with different uses across several everyday wars lasting up until the present day. Lee’s entry on “Monsanto Pesticides” is an example of how the description of these militarized objects are reinscribed with meaning in several different contexts spanning multiple decades that challenge the exceptionality of war in history-writing and demonstrate how the effects of wars lived multiple generations after their ‘ending’ are themselves actually part of this wartime. Lee demonstrates this by explaining how the movement of pesticides in both “private and public spaces highlights the arbitrariness and porousness of distinctions between wartime and peacetime and between domestic, agricultural and militarized demarcations of territory.”  Even through her structure of the entry, listing the different wars where pesticides were reinscribed with militarized meaning, like the Vietnam War and Plan Colombia, pushes against this mystification of wartime, demonstrating how these uses are not exceptional at all but actually deeply embedded in our everyday lives, an example being DDT wallpapers for children’s rooms in the 1940s. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Our attempts at challenging what a ‘militarized object’ could mean and how everyday items took/continue to take on new meanings through militarism is an endeavor we have taken as a means to address the violence embedded in the “[routinizing] of war, specifically in how it is remembered, documented and archived.”  Many other examples were raised. Aika Sato, in her object entry on “The Politics of the ‘Comfort Women Statue’” illustrates how the act of focusing on the “extraordinary” allows for the construction of this “static archetype” of comfort women to erase the existing “residues of pain in survivors” under the guise of nationalist rhetoric.  Sato’s centering of survivor’s “highly subjective pain” and the call for comfort women to actually be in control of their own pasts puts history-writing into crisis, specifically its routinized manner of “conceal[ing], disguis[ing]” and “supress[ing] the everyday.”  Henry Zhang, in his object entry on “Straw Sandals”, thinks about the nation-state’s enduring role in history-writing in how the “allegorical content” of straw sandals has nearly been monopolized in attempts to concretize existing national myths across multiple governments. ‘Such sandals are a metonym for socialist zeal and parsimony, linked to the Long March (1934-1935)’ and yet nowadays, they can be found as ‘a stock picture […] on the Chinese retail site, Taobao.’ In Minh Huynh Vu’s contribution to our collective writing exercise, they explore the potential in thinking of the “formation” of mundane militarism through the “lens of memory.”  The intention of focusing on how the ‘mundane’ could be used as an “access point” for histories that have been “actively forgotten by top-down definitions of militarism from governments, textbooks, and policies that privilege whiteness, English and masculinity.” In doing this, Huynh Vu is showing how we can interrupt routinized manners of history-writing and simultaneously delegitimize the ‘objective’ “dominant institutional ideology.”  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In their object entry, Huynh Vu concretizes this even further. They think of cardboard boxes that were converted into ‘cardboard cribs’ in Vietnam during the “Operation Babylift.”  Here, “babies are […] prepped, packaged, shipped, and delivered - a makeshift warehouse of industrial intimacies.”  Such same cardboard boxes, this time containing “Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) lunchboxes,’ were ‘airdropped to soldiers starting in 1961.”  While the boxes did provide the soldiers with nutrition, they were barely satisfactory. “The caloric and nutritional extent of the lunchboxes are constructed based upon a minimum, similar to how the cardboard cribs were allocated a particular amount of baby formula, diapers, and blankets.”  The main criteria for the food was ‘“acceptability,”’ ‘the boxes must simply be edible so that the soldiers can continue their military conduct, ’ while the food itself however, was ‘“uniformly awful.”  The cardboard boxes, whether ‘paradoxical sites of tender torture,’ or as a simple means to an end, focusing on ‘“subsistence” - as opposed to “sustenance”’ represent the very essence of how the most mundane objects can bear the traces of past militarisms.  Sato’s freewrite response speaks to this supposed ‘objectivity,'' specifically how the binary of a “victim/perpetrator identity'' entertains this “ institutional ideology” and in the process of reducing the everyday to this binary, is participating in the violent attempt at “fixing meaning” through this illusion of a ‘shared’ ‘objective past.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      While delegitimizing this belief in ‘objectivity’ within history-writing, our object entries actively function as mediums through which the idea of wartime is “demystif[ied].”  An example of this could be seen with Siri Lee’s entry “Yank’s Magic Carpet” consisting of a critical description of a souvenir booklet that was made for U.S. personnel in China, Burma and India in 1945. Lee is “demystifying” wartime and its exceptionality by detailing how the language used in this booklet maps out a U.S. soldier's experience overseas as if it was a “tourist and fairytale experience rather than a military one.”  Through this entry, Lee makes clear how Yank, the Army Weekly, was using these booklets in attempts to illustrate the military experience through a “touristic filtering.”  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In terms of “war trauma and reconciliation,” Aika Sato expands on this in our shared freewrite response and thinks about the actors of reconciliations and its purpose. Sato follows this by explaining how “war trauma and lingering animosity does not fit into a linear, teleological narrative,” and simultaneously contributing to this demystification of wartime through the direct criticism of how ‘reconciliation’ most often than not does not center those who are reliving these wars everyday.  Sato, through her freewrite is also putting into question this linearity of wartime, arguing that this clear before and after, with reconciliation following an ‘after’ is deeply problematic in how it creates a “single master narrative” and the belief of a “resolution of closure” that immediately absolves governments of their active roles in the continuation of war, echoing both Agamben and Dudziak.

                      Wartime then, is not as simple as just the beginning and ending of a conflict. War does not end once ‘a treaty is signed’  Based on a writing exercise we did to prepare for this essay, co-written between 10 people, the lingering effects between war and its past into the current present on a more personal level have also become strikingly clear. Maeva O’Brien wrote about her grandfather who “was a boy in Tokyo during WWII, and his memories of it are suffused with fire, violence, and starvation.”  These resounding memories guided O’Brien when growing up, ‘and it taught [her] a number of values: the importance of education, the fragility and power of historiography, the disaster of war, the dangers of empire and nationalism.’ Aika Sato wrote about her own experience as someone ‘born to a Japanese father and a Chinese mother, [she]grew up in both countries, witnessing the past haunting the present […] : [her] Chinese classmates called [her] a “little Japanese” and all turned around staring at [her], as if [she] were the enemy that the teacher was passionately and indignantly uttering about during a history class on the Nanjing Massacre.’ 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Alex Whee Kim wrote about how the disappearance of his great-great-grandfather still impacts his family today, with an “empty myo – a figure of absence to embed a multigenerational reminder of [their] filial impiety […] until restitution is made.” All of these examples suggest that even once a war has ended on paper (all of these examples speak of the effects of World War II), the remnants continue to have an impact for generations to come. This is what Marianne Hirsch calls postmemory, ‘distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection.”  It “characterizes the experience of those who grow up dominated by narratives that receded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated.”  Michael Rothberg takes this idea further, stating that ‘postmemory may well constitute a particular version of memory’s multidirectionality.’ In his Multidirectional Memory, Rothberg “emphasiz[es] that coming to terms with the past always happens in comparative contexts and via the circulation of memories linked to what are only apparently separate histories and national or ethnic constituencies.”  Such “separate histories” are apparent in the object stories, discussions and collective writing exercises we have done throughout this class, where modern retail sites clash with 1940s sandals; cardboard boxes come together with Vietnam war time cribs; and ancestors influence future generations for years to come.

                      What is there to do when the archive yields no testimony—or worse, when it reveals only “lowly lives reduced to ashes in the few phrases that have destroyed them”? This is Foucault’s question in “The Life of Infamous Men,” and Saidiya Hartman echoes it in her lamentation for an enslaved woman named Venus: “no one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or observed that she refused to say anything at all. Hers is an untimely story told by a failed witness… The archive is, in this case, a death sentence, a tomb, a display of the violated body, an inventory of property, a medical treatise on gonorrhea, a few lines about a whore’s life, an asterisk in the grand narrative of history.”
