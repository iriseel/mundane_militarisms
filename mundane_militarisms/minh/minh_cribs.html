              Description:
              The ongoing afterlife of Operation Babylift is imprinted within the folds, creases, and perforations of the cardboard boxes that cradled over 2,500 Vietnamese children outside of Vietnam, forecasting the Fall of Saigon while fostering an international network of adoption, orphanage, and forced assimilation.

              The above photographs sequence an insidious narrative of U.S. empire, tying an inextricable link between state-sanctioned kinship relations with the seemingly irrelevant and innocuous history of packaging. Left to right, babies are respectively prepped, packaged, shipped, and delivered—a makeshift warehouse of industrial intimacies. As material and metaphorical vessels, these cardboard cribs are paradoxical sites of tender torture: to care for cargo—to coddle, to count; to cherish, to cheapen; to caress, to confine.
          </p>

          <p>
              The legacy of Operation Babylift has been predominantly narrated through reductive statistical reports or recuperative oral histories that reify the United States as a liberal empire of benevolent refugee rescue. All of the photos come from American archives of war departments, adoption agency nurses, prior presidents, and airport personnel. However, a careful consideration of cardboard—its folds and flaps—as an architecture of corrugated surrogacy disrupts the linear narrative of refugee rescue. Instead, these boxes construct another side of the “polyhedron” of U.S. imperial care work, prompting another way of historical looking—not seeing—in our ongoing reckoning of the War in Vietnam.
          </p>

          <p>
              Yến Lê Espiritu’s seminal study, Body Counts (2014), remains salient in a study of Operation Babylift. Her titular provocation refers to the necropolitical modus operandi of the U.S. Army, which weaponized the “number of confirmed Vietnamese kills” in order to “chart U.S. progress in the war.” In turn, Espiritu grammatically inverts the militarized term, from noun to verb, “to insist that bodies—Vietnamese bodies—should count” (emphasis in original). Yet, as the archival canon of Operation Babylift reveals, body counts in both senses of the phrase. In an interview with Adopt Vietnam, a modern travel and parenting guide for Westerners, LeAnn Thieman—a presidentially-endorsed nurse and adoptee representative during the 1975 evacuation—weaves a seamless progress narrative of liberal humanism, demonizing communist rebels as inhumane murderers while praying for rebirth and renewal back at the U.S. homelands.
          </p>

          <p>
              “The last planeload of orphans leaving Saigon for America had blown up shortly after takeoff. It was still unknown whether it had been shot down or sabotaged [neither was the case, as the first plane—a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy crashed due to human error and structural failure] … Would history repeat itself?... I began to say the Lord’s Prayer as the plane taxied down the runway … Finally the American captain spoke. ‘We are out of range of the Vietcong. We are safe. We are going home.’ ... We were part of a plan that could make a difference in the world.”
          </p>

          <p>
              In a twisted perversion of Espiritu’s grammatical reformulation, here Thieman orally and visually registers how the newly domesticated orphans count especially because of the count of previously deceased orphans. Counting, then, is not solely numerical but simultaneously affective—a hard and soft imperial violence operationalized through the assignment of value in relation to economy, emotionality, and emergency.
          </p>

          <p>
              The cardboard cribs—itself a disturbing phrase—are ephemeral sites of evidence to inhabit and intimate the mass production of intimacies as imperial commodities. Although the babies counted as helpless victims, they were nevertheless counted as numbers on budget reports and death ledgers. While indexing the possibility of life for the Vietnamese orphans, the photograph(er)s are insistent in centralizing the cardboard boxes, their geometrical standardization, and their ensconced situatedness within military and commercial aircrafts.
          </p>

          <p>
              Aesthetically, the cardboard sutures material and directional uniformity into each photograph while structuring viewers’ gaze based on the absence or presence of babies. One cannot avoid the foreshadowed conscription of the Vietnamese children, eerily organized rank and file in the third photograph, or their ceremonial assimilation into America, marked by the multiracial and linear descent from the plane in the fourth photograph. Who(se) were these babies in the unnamed boxes? Upon departure and arrival, whom were healthy, sick, or dead? The standardization of these cardboard boxes and their obfuscating corrugations preclude these questions of existence.  
          </p>

          <p>
              The aesthetic operations of cardboard were part and parcel to the material’s economic and legal motivations starting in the mid 1960s. In early 1965, as U.S. military presence grew in South Vietnam, a region marked by a lack of infrastructural development, the government faced “what may have been the greatest logistical mess in the history of U.S. armed forces” (emphasis mine). To “clean up” this mess, the U.S. military consulted entrepreneur Malcolm McLean, the founder of the “containerization” movement who devised a “way in which cargo could be shifted seamlessly from trucks to ships to trains, without loss of delay.” Contracted by the U.S. government, McLean built ports along the Vietnam border which would create a robust economy of exports; his ships “delivered 1,200 containers a month to Vietnam” efficiently and reliably. Given its logistical economy, the War in Vietnam is regarded as giving “birth to the container”—not just specifically McLean’s shipping vessel, but synecdochally modern-day global trade and its logics of standardized package and delivery. By law, materials sent to and from the U.S. federal government must be packaged in V3c boxes, which are corrugated “military shipping containers” that are “chemically treated” using “weatherized corrugated fiberboard” to protect “products manufactured exclusively for the government.” During the active combat phase of the War in Vietnam, these V3c boxes were filled with military rations, explosive, and ammo to fuel soldiers and machines.
          </p>

          <p>
              However, during American withdrawal from Vietnam—through de-escalatory programs such as Operation Babylift—we see the retooling and resignifying of V3c boxes. Note the tiny “V3c” imprints in the first and second photos. Although miniscule, this detail profoundly illuminates the imaginative, innovative, and industrious logics of U.S. imperialism. Consistent in form but inconsistent in function across the decade, the cardboard containers—then for nukes but now for newborns—reveal the fungibilizing logics of commodification. Crates then cradles, cardboard functioned as the medium to convert children qua cargo. As much as Operation Babylift was rationalized through ethical and sentimental imperative, the policy’s underpinning logics ultimately root back to its own name. A matter of market logistics, the Operation conceived children as quantities—unnamed and categorized by size and price. Some boxes held up to three babies (bottom of the second photograph), and processing centers, such as one in San Francisco, kept inventory: “7,886 bottles of formula, at least 10,000 disposable diapers, 2,000 cotton tipped swabs and 750 cotton balls, 1,440 aspirin tablets, gallons of baby powder, ointment by the bushel, toothpaste and towels.” In his memoir after the legal end to the War in Vietnam, President Gerald Ford rationalizes altruism in arithmetic language; he “directed that money from a $2 million special foreign aid children’s fund” in order “to cut through any red tape that might stand in the way of the children’s escape.” In this budgetary framework, cardboard cribs were a matter of expedient exportation, not comprehensive childcare. Because the corrugated boxes were chemically coated to store metallic weapons and canned foods, temperatures would often rise and cause babies to “fatally over-heat.”
          </p>

          <p>
              As spatial palimpsests of everyday militarisms, these cardboard cribs prompt historical pause and reconsideration. If you look closely at the middle of the third photograph, specifically the two children on the rightmost row, you will see that their legs extend beyond their respective cribs; they outsize the cardboard boxes’ dimensions. On the one hand, we can look through a paranoid lens, and conclude that the numerical mattered more than the ethical in the biopolitical management of Vietnamese children’s bodies; the one-size-fits-all boxes could only accommodate those fortunate enough: “to make live and let die.” On the other hand, we can look through a reparative lens, and imagine the alternative modes of embodied kinship and intimacy that could exceed and exist beyond the racial enclosures of U.S. empire and its corrugated surrogacy, rendering inoperative—even if momentarily—the Operation. Either way, the cardboard cribs capture the ongoing crisis of U.S. imperial care work: Whether “emergency or emerging” identities, Vietnamese orphans and adoptees signaled radical transformations of the world order and its structure of kinship.
