                 Chinese "Scarecrow" 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="description">
            <p>
                “Each day the Shanghainese gov’t reaches a new low; barricading roads, stapling metal sheets onto our doors, locking the main entrances of buildings. Ignoring fire hazards and medical risks—even breaking fire safety laws! Of course, some [of them] just set up these ‘scarecrows’; who wouldn’t be terrified, seeing this white thing at night?”

              </p>

            <p>
                These are words that Weibo user, Shixingchennianhua, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/remonwangxt/status/1517911779820589056">posted</a> midway through the month-long lockdown enforced by Shanghai’s municipal government on its residents, in an effort to expunge the highly contagious Omicron variant. Food shortages, overtaxed hospitals, and family separations resulted, prompting public outrage—the belated, but furious realization that the cure, and not the sickness, is killing people.  
              </p>

              <p>
                  The “scarecrow” mentioned here is an effigy of a Chinese public health volunteer—the CCP’s biopolitical enforcer, a 21st-century, white-clad descendent of the ubiquitous Red Guard. Stuck to its chest is a piece of A4 paper, printed with the Chinese text, “This building has implemented social isolation measures/ those who violate the rules by exiting must bear the consequences.”
              </p>

              <p>
                  I have found little on the history of scarecrows in China (though Japan seems to have records dating back to 700 CE). In Europe, the first scarecrows were likely “<a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/172022?rskey=rhg1mO&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid">person[s] employed in scaring birds</a>” (<i>OED</i>), but after the population die-off during the 14th century bubonic plague, such hired, human help—often children—was replaced by inanimate human likenesses. 
              </p>

              <p>
                  But if, as the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/scarecrow-agriculture"><i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i></a> says with accidental lyricism (iambs, even), “its name derives from use against the crow,” then what to call a scarecrow meant for humans? “A scarecrow outfitted in clothes previously worn by a hunter who has fired on the flock,” the entry continues, “is regarded by some as especially efficacious,” enabling various analogies, from folksy to poli-sci: a cat burned by a hot stove afraid of cold stoves, politics war by other means, no hegemony without domination, and so on.
              </p>

              <p>
                  But though this “frightening, white thing” is an icon for the faceless, government delegates who implement the Chinese state's hygienic regime, its material construction tells a different story. Its suit is ill-fitting, draped over a T-shaped metal frame, then stretched to accommodate a boxy torso, like a person who has swallowed a first-aid kit. Its legs are bent forward at an impossible angle, then trussed like a turkey, suggesting an almost comical helplessness; its arms, surely intended to forbid approaching residents, also appear to be outflung in exaggerated embrace; its eyes, two nails, look sleepy, not menacing. This scarecrow was built with an amateur’s carelessness, or even desperation—one is reminded of stories of some volunteers, fainting from overwork, propped up by the patients they are supposed to be attending to. Such idiosyncrasies force viewers to “look at,” not merely to “see” (viz., to take for granted), the state’s authority in all its frailty and contingency, in the same way <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/714000898">a counterfeit bill, once detected, forces us to consider the invisible hands that made it</a> (Mwangi 31). Though it <i>ought</i> to serve as metonym of bureaucratic capitalism and panoptic control, this scarecrow hints, dialectically, at the ways that the system fails forward, borne on the fumbling fingers of its acolytes.
              </p>

              <p>
                  This object also speaks to the ways that evidentiary standards change transnationally. Shixing’s post was deleted, alongside its author’s Weibo account, long before I started to write this object story. Comments to posts like these are mostly rueful variations of, “Read this while you still can—it’ll be gone in no time.” The photos I have attached are screenshots, pulled from Twitter; they therefore document, not just the hazmatted scarecrow, but the act of documentation itself, its attendant discontents. Chinese netizens are familiar with two forms of ephemerality: the first, a sense that breakneck social change means the average lifespan of a meme is so short as to deny viewers a chance for even a proper <i>first look</i>, let alone a doubletake—what Ackbar Abbas calls the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41389334"><i>déjà disaparu</i></a>; and the second, intermittent social upheavals that threaten “conditions that allow a speech act—be it truth-telling, oath-making, or command-giving — to mean anything,” in <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/essays/disambiguation-a-tragedy/">Nan Z. Da’s formulation</a>. 
              </p>

              <p>
                  By highlighting the illiberal nature of Chinese governmentality, I do not mean to valorize liberal-bourgeois nation-states. It is true that in what Rey Chow calls the global visual economy, posts like Shixing’s become hot commodities among American neocons who sponsor <i>Economist </i>articles calling for regime change in China. This does not, however, vitiate local activists’ efforts to preserve, at all costs, evidence of their government's misdeeds. To subsume local struggles into transnational circuits of exchange amounts, in Da’s words, to “the subsumption of the finer points of Chinese diasporic identities into Asian American and identity politics narratives.”
              </p>

              <p>
                  I am all too aware, as well, that yearning for conditions under which one might “cite properly” partakes of a certain “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07407709608571228">regime of rigor</a>,” which privatizes the public domain, barring horizontal knowledge-sharing with vertical paywalls. I merely want to point out that a Foucauldian suspicion of archives becomes less tenable when there are no archives to be suspicious of; that exposing hierarchies congealed and concealed by “best practices” is difficult when the institutions we want to critique might literally be dismantled overnight.  
              </p>

              <p>
                  Fully stocked grocery stores, revealed to be Potemkin villages; non-compliant elders, brutalized by security guards; low-ranking government delegates, sobbing to their constituents—before such images were taken up by the Western press, they were shared, spontaneously, by Shanghainese protestors. Is it any wonder why the latter might yearn to secure, by means of the former, an archival solidity for the images that have been transformed into bureaucratic capitalist ephemera before their very eyes?
