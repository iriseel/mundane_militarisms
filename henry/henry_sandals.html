                  Straw Sandals
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="description">
            <p>
                “Pure handmade woven straw sandals men’s summer vintage sandals women’s Red Army re-enactment all-natural straw”: this is <a href="https://www.taobao.com/list/item/45835752319.htm">a product description</a> on the Chinese e-commerce site, Taobao, for a pair of sandals that seem despite the claim to the contrary, mass produced and antiseptic. Among the keywords, otherwise arrayed in flat parataxis, the words “Red Army” stand out.

              </p>

            <p>
                What do straw sandals have to do with the Red Army? As much, to borrow from Frederic Jameson, as mechanically reproduced, diamond dust shoes relate to German peasant boots, abraded and caressed by time and toil. Jameson’s erstwhile claim that the postmodern canon is effaced of historicity seems belied by the fact that Warhol’s painting has gone up for sale at a <a href="https://www.guyhepner.com/artist/andy-warhol-art-prints-paintings/diamond-dust-shoes/">New York gallery</a> (inquire for price), which calls them “primary motifs” of the 1980s, thereby freezing them in art historical amber. And this recalls an older, Benjaminian concern: what if, despite the best laid plans of cultural iconoclasts, the aura always sneaks back into the work of art?
              </p>

              <p>
                  So it is with these Taobao sandals, which speak less of a <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/V/bo15260849.html">Chinese copycat sensibility</a>, as theorized by Western media, and more to the ways that socialist historiography is sublated—canceled and preserved—by marketplaces like Taobao. In the image above, a merchant uses a discursive bait and tackle—the words, “Red Army”—to fish for&nbsp; readerly reverence: the history of socialist voluntarism, in which zeal and parsimony delivered a detachment of guerilla fighters through bourgeois encirclement and fascist aggression to found the largest East Asian worker’s state.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Straw sandals figure in even in early 20th century socialist culture. A 1930s <a href="https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;dbname=CJFDLAST2020&amp;filename=GZWD202011008&amp;uniplatform=NZKPT&amp;v=Zm0Jm3w7-bBrTitWdV17ofrPV8qu1Cnd3_VfMkTivsAqHR78caeU5_71R6JnEQKQ">Chinese folk song</a> goes like this: “Su Qu’s cadres, style surpassed by none/ carry their millet and get work done/ wear straw sandals, make rebellion when there’s sun/ light lanterns and visit peasants when there’s none” (my translation). Such earthy integrity is supposed to have infused the highest ranks of the Red Army: <a href="https://kns.cnki.net/kns8/defaultresult/index">>A search on <i>CNKI</i></a>, an essay database comparable to <i>JSTOR</i>, turns up dozens of articles in which “straw sandal” modifies the names of middle-to-high ranking members of the CCP: “Straw Sandal Party Secretary Zhou Yongkai: Always Standing Among the People”; “He Long: The Revolutionary Who Took His Boots off and Donned Straw Sandals”; “Zhu De Patches Straw Sandals for the Troops”; and so on.

              </p>

              <p>
                  Laura Wexler documents <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9780807848838/tender-violence/">two forms of domesticity</a> deployed by the US government in its imperial endeavors: “the unheimlich [uncanny] intended for domestic consumption” and “the heimlich (private) as a kind of propaganda.” Two, paradigmatic instances of straw sandals serve similar functions, albeit for nativist, not imperial, ends. The first is <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ba_lu_bian_chao_xie.jpg">a photo of a pair of Eighth Route soldiers</a>, sitting on rocky terrain and braiding such sandals by hand, using their feet to pin wooden sticks into makeshift “looms.” The image (taken during the second Sino-Japanese War) is particularly memorable because their feet are bare—as though the men’s self-sacrificing spirit compelled them to literally push their shoes to the point of disintegration before they allowed themselves to finally fashion new ones. The image authorizes a kind of state feminism: Their activity cuts across the domestic sphere and battlefront, hinting that in the virtuous Red Army, not only do men make clothes, but <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt2ttbrr">women march</a> to war.
              </p>

              <p>
                  The second object, however, once more erects a wall between these two spheres: the straw sandals enshrined in the memorial hall at the starting point of the Long March. According to the legend, endlessly repeated on <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/2021-05/27/c_1127490258.htm">China’s official press</a>, these sandals were made by a peasant girl, Chun Xiu, for her childhood sweetheart, Xie Zhijian, before he joined the revolution. Loath to damage them, Xie wore the shoes only twice in all his years of military service, and both in times of mortal danger, when his own survival, let alone the shoes’, seemed less than likely. When the war was finally done, however, Xie returned home to discover that Chun had been killed by Nationalist troops in his absence.
              </p>

              <p>
                  The average pair of straw shoes is kind of flat oblong, attached with a few, simple straps at different intervals—heel, arch, and toes—to keep the foot from falling out; they are shaped identically, meaning that the left and right foot can basically be worn interchangeably. Chun Xiu’s shoes, however, are obviously fashioned for left and right foot; the soles of the sandals extend, halfway down, into a semi-closed compartment for the toes; the heels are supported not by the usual, minimalist thong, but by several cords of thickly-woven straw. But what is most jarring about these sandals—what Roland Barthes calls <a href="https://garagemca.org/en/programs/publishing/roland-barthes-roland-barthes-camera-lucida-reflections-on-photography"><i>the punctum</i></a>, that incidental detail with the power to wound the viewer—are the pom poms sewn onto their toe straps. Stereotypically feminine—pink, decorative, fluffy, even maudlin—these pom poms resemble (which is not to say they are derivative of) a lady’s favor; a kind of useless, colorful scrap, that augments the knight errant who carries it into battle or an honorable death.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Kayla Schuller <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-biopolitics-of-feeling">posits a continuum</a> between an “invincible, unfeeling” black body and the “neurasthenic, hypersensitive” woman; here is a different, affective economy—not socialist realism, but Chinese melodrama. The good, socialist woman, the shoes suggest, is capable of great feats of sentiment—she not only gives the man she cares about a pair of working shoes, she adds details that will make him want to live, to return to her; and yet her love is <i>too much</i>, so much that Xie was infected by her feelings, and therefore loath to wear her sandals—so much that he refused donate them to the state. Prevailed on, several times, to serve his people—this time as a onetime donor of a single, revolutionary treasure—Xie finally relented. The sandals’ journey from rural China to one of the temples of socialist history allegorizes the ways that excessive sentiment must be stoked—then ultimately contained (and literally, too, by a museum display case), lest it unman the soldiers who gaze on it without the proper mediation.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Xie, for his part, is reported to have returned, even unto old age and infirmity (one wonders if he had a heart condition) to gaze at the sandals, supported by his grandchildren.
