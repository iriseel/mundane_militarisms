                 Letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="description">
            <p>
                It is a strange, old looking, odd sized letter, without a date or much other definitive information, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The letter is clouded in uncertainty. It was discovered upon the refurbishment of a house in New Hampshire, then put away and re-discovered years later, this, already, an indication of its ungraspable nature. What is the background behind the letter? What was its purpose? There are two entirely separate and entirely unrelated possible explanations.

              </p>

            <p>
                On the one hand, The National WWII Museum archive have dated the letter as 22 October 1944 and associated it with ‘The Bernard J, Mertzweiler, Jr. Collection 2012.’ Their letter, (see above) is the exact same letter as the one I found, with the only exception of a date that was written, by hand, onto the top left of the letter. This date, ‘Oct. 22, 1944’ as well as Roosevelt’s signature are the only hand written elements of the letter which is otherwise entirely typed. The inclusion of the letter in the ‘The Bernard J. Mertzweiller, Jr. Collection 2012,’ suggests, that the letter was sent to the ‘559th Bombardment Squadron (M), 9th Air Force’ (2022) in 1944. Bernard J. Mertzweiler Jr. was one of the members of this Bombardment Squadron. In July 1944, ‘subsequent to the Allied invasion of the continent, the 387th,’ which the 559th Bombardment Squadron was a part of, ‘moved to Stony Cross […] and on to a series of bases in France […] for the mission that resulted in a Distinguished Unit Citation for the Group, awarded for hitting transportation and communication targets at Mayen and Prum, Germany during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 to January 1945.’ (Smith, 2017) 
              </p>

              <p>
                  The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum on the other hand, have associated an entirely different date – and location - with the letter. According to them, it ‘was delivered to every soldier and sailor in the US Expeditionary Force as they were about to storm the beaches of North Africa.’ (Sparrow 2017) It was sent out in direct connection with Operation Torch which ‘began on Nov. 8, 1942, with the invasion of Morocco and Algeria.’ (Mallouli & Sweeney, 2019)  Unfortunately, ‘the first phase of air operations in North Africa, in November and December 1942, was characterized by unforeseen problems and obstacles compounded by the inexperience of the units involved.’ (Bechthold, 2004) ‘In late December, this led to ‘Eisenhower [bringing] an end to the first stage of operations in North Africa.’ (Bechthold, 2004) 
              </p>

              <p>
                  It is difficult to definitively determine the original time stamp of this letter. However, in the 1940s, Europe was a place that was much more familiar to the US than North Africa. After all, as Mallouli and Sweeney claim, ‘no academic research could be located that examines U.S. print press portrayals of North Africans and Arabs during World War II in general and during Operation Torch in particular.’  (Mallouli & Sweeney, 2019) It could therefore be argued that the ‘distant places’ mentioned in the second paragraph of the letter, may more likely refer to North Africa than France and central Europe. Moreover, the address at the front of the envelope seems to suggest, that the addressee was part of medical detachment 6418, not a bombardment group within the air force. 
              </p>

              <p>
                  The letter itself is a letter of encouragement and praise to ‘the United States Army Expeditionary Forces.’ The encouragement is apparent throughout the letter. Interestingly, Roosevelt actually makes the decision to separate himself from the soldiers, drawing a very clear line between the ‘you’ of the soldiers, and the ‘we’ of those ‘who stay[ed] at home.’ There are in fact 13 occurrences of ‘you’ or ‘your,’ as opposed to the single occurrence of ‘we,’ suggesting that he is putting the focus entirely on the soldiers and almost minimises the role of himself as the president. His position as president is, in fact, not mentioned until the very last word of the letter. In a sentence that is entirely focused on the soldiers, who ‘bear with [them ...] hope, […] confidence, […] gratitude and […] prayers,’ of their families and citizens, Roosevelt chooses the last word, almost as an extension of his own signature, ‘your president.’ He is including himself in the dept owed to the soldiers but only makes mention of himself as their president in the two last paragraphs. The soldiers are responsible for ‘the freedom of the lives of those you love - your fellow-citizens – your people.’ These people are a ‘god-fearing, proud, courageous,’ people, putting their ‘freedom under God before all other purposes.’ In the second to last paragraph, importantly, he acknowledges that he himself, included in the 'we,’ owes his 'duties […] in many ways to [the soldiers].’ This suggests that he shares the respect and gratitude of the soldiers’ loved ones.
              </p>

              <p>
                  This respect to the soldiers is also reflected in the fact that the name and address of the envelope are hand written. It is difficult to decipher, but the letter seems to be addressed to one Private James D. Remilton. Though I was not able to find any more information on this person himself, the uncertainty regarding the recipient of the letter, as well as the different times and locations associated with the letter only make it more of a fascinating military object.
