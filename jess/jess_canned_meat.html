          <div class="description">
            <p>
                Growing up in Hialeah, Florida, the city with the largest population of Cubans outside of the island, meant that the Cold War was still incredibly present in my community’s everyday life, not only in conversations we would have at the dinner table and the news but also in the items that our local grocery stories carried everyday. One example of these ‘remnants’ of the 1960s-1980s were the stacked varieties of Russian canned meat, or tushonka which continue to be available in many stores across Hialeah. When asking my family members and those of my friends back home about their memories with Russian canned meat, I noticed that nearly all of the of the brands they would list were all U.S. manufactured, the most mentioned being Levadia (Hernandez-Reguant & Loss). I immediately made the assumption that one of the reasons why these cans were being manufactured in the United States had to do with the demand of earlier generations of Cuban immigrants that were nostalgic over a food staple that fundamentally shaped their everyday life growing up on the island while living in South Florida. After these calls, I began researching Levadia and learned that the first cans of tushonka were actually manufactured in the U.S. midwest, more specifically at meatpacking plants in Iowa and Ohio.” (Smith, 178). The history of tushonka goes beyond the relationship between the Soviet Union and Cuba throughout the 1960s-1980s, it encompasses the United States, other members that existed within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and as of recent has been driven by Latin American countries like Mexico and Nicaragua.

              </p>

            <p>
                Carne rusa en lata, tushonka, “defense ham,” are all just some of the names that were given to the several varieties of this packaged spiced meat, first manufactured in metal cans during World War II in the United States (Anderson, 132). According to Smith, World War II was a crucial moment for American livestock producers, in that the heightened necessity for food products that could endure the “rough handling” of war aided in drawing them out of the depression. (Anderson, 131)(Smith, 178). These U.S. packers sent large amounts of canned pork to both American service members and allies, a fundamental one being the Soviet Union’s Red Army. These U.S. meatpacking manufacturers were almost all involved in government contracts that heavily assisted in their economic recovery, to the extent that they were able to take “special request orders,” with one of them consisting of a recipe for tushonka (Smith, 178).
              </p>

              <p>
                  Tushonka originated from a recipe for preserved meat that “had been a traditional product of the Ural mountains” and rather than storing them “in jars with salt and fat,” this need for long shelf-life and “rough-handling” led to both “pressure and heat” becoming a central element of its mass-production (Anderson, 132)(Smith, 178). This request for a canned version of Russian dish, came after multiple shipments of SPAM were sent to the Red Army throughout 1942 when the Red Army’s quartermaster requested for a “more familiar canned pork product, Russian tushonka” (Smith, 178). As mentioned by Smith, what differentiates canned tushonka from other war rations like SPAM, is that these cans did not phase out after the war, rather, they began to be “distributed to the Soviet civilian population, appearing in charity donations and on the shelves of state shops.” (Smith, 178). Ultimately tushonka “rose from obscurity to become an emblem of socialist modernity” not only within the Soviet Union but also as a core export that connected multiple COMECON members throughout the 1970s like Cuba (Smith, 178). The meaning that these portions of canned meat carried radically shifted beginning in the 1960s, where not only did it become this “unusual byproduct of the Cold War era” transnationally, but it also served as a “highly visible product” that the Soviet Union wanted to promote as a “modern food regime” that maintained the purpose of “[rivaling] that of the United States” (Smith, 178). With the manufacturing of tushonka being straightforward and these products being easily transportable, canned meat became one of the most exported items to COMECON members throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (Smith, 178).
              </p>

              <p>
                  Loss in Dreaming in Russian argues that “taste, tone and humor” continue to be crucial elements needed to begin “unveiling” the complicated, and often contradictory, histories of “Sovietization” within Cuba and also across the Soviet Bloc (Loss, 20). Embedded in these memories that Cubans, many pertaining to the Muñequitos Rusos generation, “consisting of Cubans who came of age in the 1980s and who were raised on Soviet Bloc cartoons,” one could connect these retellings to Dudziak’s arguments of wartime, where this generation is grounding itself in the past, living in the present, and conceptualizing the future simultaneously (Dudziak, 22). This can be seen with Cuba’s entrance into COMECON in July, 1972, the moment where one begins to see this rapid increase in imported Soviet foods like tushonka. The Cuban government, beginning in 1972 became “tightly bound” to the Soviet bloc in ways that went beyond the economic. Yet, this “Sovietization” was heavily influenced by these economic “five-year plans'' constructed with Soviet advisors (Loss, 20). One example is through the Cuban diet, where recipes began to incorporate tushonka as the primary meat source, consisting of ropa vieja, or shredded (canned) beef, or stuffed in croquetas, or croquettes and lastly in picadillo, accompanied with salsas, tomatoes, raisins and olives to name a few. There were many reasons why the Cuban government decided to join COMECON, one being that the United States was almost less than 90 miles away, and having the U.S. intervention of Guatemala in 1954 as an recent example, the support of the Soviet military in the 1970s was crucial in order guarantee the future of the revolution (Gott, 239). As Baldacci states, the entrance of Cuba to COMECON contributed to the already “rapid change” that had defined the island throughout the 1960s and 1970s with the consolidation of the revolutionary government and the need to seek out “a viable political and economic future in communism” (Baldacci, 246).
              </p>

              <p>
                  Although these three decades became heavily associated with this “rapid change,” one aspect that remained constant was the extent to which the Cuban government relied on other members of COMECON for foodstuffs (Baldacci, 236). The importation of foodstuffs was essential in aiding the island against the continued economic war against the United States. The drastic effects of the blockade can be immediately seen less than 10 years after its enactment. The peak year of Socialist country imports into the island (COMECON, Albania, North Korea and Yugoslavia) was 1968, only six years after the implementation of the economic blockade (Baldacci, 236). I believe it is important to note that this canned meat, initially manufactured in the American Midwest less than 20 years prior, transformed itself into a staple that to this day, even though to a smaller degree, still aids the island’s active resistance against the U.S.blockade.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Throughout the years leading up to the Special Period, (1986-1988), the second highest food import coming from COMECON members was canned meat, and within this, 63 percent of these food imports were directly supplied by Russia (Deere, 6) (Gott, 287). From 1968 and up until the dissolution of the Soviet Union (even after the end of Cuba’s membership in the COMECON), rationed Soviet canned meat consumption continued to be a staple at the dinner table. With the enactment of the blockade and the increase in COMECON foodstuff importation came an “initially temporary” rationing programme that guaranteed that Cubans had “equal access to scarce foodstuffs at highly subsidized prices'' beginning in the late-1960s, la carne rusa became heavily associated with the maintenance of libreta ration books across the island (Baldacci, 235). These ration books became a reflection of the rapidly shifting relationships between COMECON members and the island, where the lack of certain imports like canned meat acted as a reflection of the faltering relationship between the Soviet Union and the island, but more broadly its entire existence up until 1991 (Gott, 274).
              </p>

                  With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 came the beginning of el Período especial en tiempos de paz, or the Special Period in the Time of Peace. During this period, the Cuban government was actively reorienting itself after the collapse of the country that had “provided financial backing for Cuba’s socialist experiment for 20 years, and [was] the source of its military security for over three decades” (Gott, 273). In this moment of drastic “transition” there was this urgency to 'reorient', to think about the errors of the past, ground them in the present and critically think about the future of the revolution’s principles. Yet, in this “transitioning” there was an overlooking of the loss of the Soviet Union and its influence over the everyday lives of Cubans, similar to Dudziak’s point of the “beginning of one historical period” determining the immediate “end of another” without critically reflecting on the effects of this three-decade long “Sovietization” (Loss, 15). Simultaneously, during this period, Russian canned meat “disappeared from the map” and began to “[acquire] a new kind of delicacy status” (Hernandez-Reguant & Loss). According to Loss and Hernandez-Reguant, the, now, “made-in-the-U.S.A. rendition” now constitutes part of a “wide-range of ‘cultural remittances back to the island” (Hernandez-Reguant & Loss). What once was manufactured in the United States and sent to the Soviet Union and later sent from COMECON member countries to the island was now being sent from the United States to the island by the diaspora in South Florida. Loss argues in Dreaming in Russian, that with many Cubans on the island not working, traveling or “belonging to a professional echelon that relied on Soviet formation, many Cubans, both on the island and in the diaspora, are “less aware of having had ‘real’ experiences with them than having had ‘real experiences with products made by them” (Loss, 10). These 'real' experiences occured at the dinner table and to Cubans in the diaspora, occur in their attempts to remember their childhood on the island while at the grocery store or in the recreating of recipes in Miami, for example.

                  La carne rusa en lata is a crucial product that communicates Loss’ argument, where it brings back “complex layers of forward- and backward looking tensions,” more specifically, of a living contradiction, where to one generation of Cubans (Generation Y) for example, it reminds them of growing up during the first decade of the revolution (of this rapid political and economic change that accompanied these two decades), and to others, born in the 1980s, the canned meat’s absence reminds them of the hardships that came with the peak of the Special Period in the 1990s-early 2000s (Loss, 213).
              </p>

                  Beginning in 2017, there was a reappearance of canned Russian meat on the island, specifically imported from Italy (El Boletín). With its reemergence there is a re-inscribing of meaning into these cans, one of these meanings being the continued war that the island is fighting against the United States through the economic blockade. In 2021, there was an increse in importations of Russian canned meat after the island-wide protests on July 11, 2021 with one leading reason being the drastic shortages of food and medical resources. This time around, these varieties of Russian canned meat were being imported from Mexico, Russia and Nicaragua into Cuba. This specific import of Russian canned meat from Mexico, Russia and Nicaragua concurrently show the legacies of the the last three decades of the Cuban Revolution in the present. On the one hand, it shows the significance of the economic and political reorienting the government faced in relation to the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean from the 1980s-early 2000s and on the other it illustrates the shift in the relationship between Russia and Cuba the present. Yet, either the heightened presence and/or absence of these cans continue to convey moments of heightened political and economic crisis. In 2021 this crisis manifested itself in the most recent import that came as a result of the protests against the government where there has been a back-and-forth between Cubans on the island and the Ministerio del Comercio Interior, or the Ministry of Domestic Trade resulting from many of these imported cans being potentially expired (Cibercuba). Whether on the island or in the diaspora, these cans of processed meat continue to be rewritten with meaning, not only by the Cuban government but also Cubans on the island, the government’s allies, the United States government and Cuban exiles and migrants in the diaspora.
