                  War Projections and the View-Master

                There is a specific quality of light to the slide projector. A literal heat from its lamp influences its smell—a burning of dust and warming of plastic, wafted by the gentle hum of its fan. Slide projectors illuminate film’s granular materiality; their resolution is distinct and visceral. Unlike the digitally simulated RGB pixel amalgamations we experience today, slides and their projectors consist of the light of a single bulb, true shadow, and a translucent image, perhaps closer to the physical hand that pressed the camera’s shutter—to the gaze that saw the object of its attention.

              </p>

            <p>
                The sound of the Kodak Carousel projector in action is at once nostalgic and mechanically ominous. Amplification of its revolution easily mimics the cartridge of a weapon and the whir of an engine. I’d assumed my research into the projector would quickly, militaristically make itself known. Instead its engineering history proved obtusely opaque. Most articles reference the same Mad Men episode where Don Draper tugs at the heartstrings of fictional Kodak executives, premising the projector’s sentimental, affective potential. A carousel of images; a physical, temporal and metaphorical loop of memories [1]. Though it originated in the 1930s, the consumer slide projector only gained popularity in the 50s. The iconic carousel’s original design came from an Italian-American inventor, Louis Misuraca [2]. Kodak paid him a lump sum for his invention which he used for a one-time trip to Italy with his family. They “finessed his design” and released the Kodak Carousel in spring of 1962. [3]
 
              </p>

              <p>
                  Aware of its affective potential but curious towards its pragmatic utility, “slide projectors at war” replaced my initial search. I found an auction for the brutal filmstrip projector pictured above; listed as “KOREAN WAR US ARMY SIGNAL CORPS PH-222-C PROJECTOR.” It introduced me to the Signals Corps: “a branch of the US Army that creates and manages communications and information systems for the command and control of combined arms forces.”[4] The Corps was first established in 1860 during the Civil War and has since created several laboratories whose engineers have pioneered technologies such as artificially grown quartz crystals and early circuit board printing. Some of its most famous employees included Stan Lee, the comic book writer, as well as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the infamous scientists dismissed and tried for Soviet espionage during the McCarthy-era Cold War.

              <p>
                  Dr. Haidee Wasson, Professor of Film and Media at Concordia University details the Signal Corps and US War Department’s symbiotic relationship with Hollywood in her book Everyday Movies: Portable Film Projectors and the Transformation of American Culture as well as Cinema’s Military Industrial Complex. Wasson argues that through a technological evolution towards portability, the army “boldly dissembled cinema’s settled routines and structures, rearticulating film projection as but one integral element of a growing institution with highly complex needs” [5]. Eastman Kodak, Bell and Howell, and Radio Corporation of America (RCA) played a “key role in providing a technological infrastructure—cameras, film stock, lighting, lenses, projectors…” [6] Wasson notes that, “during the period 1942-1945, the Signal Corps procured more than 16,000 16mm projectors from several commercial manufacturers” [7] and that “by October 1945, Hollywood had delivered 43,189 prints of 1,941 features to the War Department, plus 33,189 prints of 1,050 shorts. The estimated number of showings per day, worldwide, was 3,500, with daily attendance of about 1.5 million.”[8]
              </p>

              <p>
                  A War Department Field Manual published in 1945 details lists and uses of films, film strips and recognition film slides to accompany the former projectors [9]. The “recognition slides” were especially intriguing. Silhouettes of enemy and ally air and naval craft were shown to soldiers, training them in identification techniques [10]. With Dr. Wasson’s notions of portability in mind, the recognition slides transitioned from squares of glass to smaller, economical 16mm film, then sandwiched between two discs of cardstock. This familiar paper disc, the View-Master reel, may elicit memories of tourist traps and Disneyland in those old enough to remember. Modeled after the stereoscope, it was first introduced at the 1939 New York World’s Fair and the 1940 Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco [11]. At the onset of WWII the View-Master almost ceased to exist when scarcity of materials halted its production. A contract with the US military for 100,000 Model B viewers and six million recognition training and range estimation reels saved it from oblivion. [12]

                  The projector’s nostalgic sentimentality disintegrates in light of its tactical function and impact on America's cinematic industry. Below are instructions for a projector should it be left behind in enemy territory.
              </p>

              <p>
                  “Smash. Smash the carrying case, housing, lenses, cigarettes, reflectors, mirrors, and projection lamps. Use sledges, axes, hand axes, pick axes, or heavy tools.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Cut. Cut the power cables and all the inside wiring. Use axes, hand axes, and machetes.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Bend. Bend all parts.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Burn. Burn case, technical manuals. Use gasoline, kerosene oil, flame throwers, or incendiary grenades.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Disposal. Bury or scatter the destroyed parts in trenches, fox holes, or throw them into ravines.
