                  Kodachrome Color Slide
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="description">
            <p>
                The photographic slide is part of an obsolescent epoch of 20th century imaging technology. It is a small, 2x2” cardboard or plastic square with a 1x1.5” window, the perfect size for a single 35mm frame. Prized by photographers for its resolution, longevity, and potential economy, the slide is known as a diapositive, dia- from ancient Greek meaning “through, across, by, over,” and positive from the Latin positivus or “to place.”[1] Rather than a photographic negative, slide film is a positive, true to the original in light, shade and color, allowing anyone with a projector to view their image without expensive printing or extensive processing. The term “slideshow” is still used today in a digital sense, but its origins exist within these cardboard celluloid squares, put on display by consumers to friends, families, businesses and institutions—anyone with a sequence to share. Kodak Kodachrome photographic slides are an iconic member of film history and a distinct turning point in the field’s color-processing chemical development. Striking, however, is that the inspiration for its iconic color technology is rooted in war and its spectacular mythologies.

              </p>

            <p>
                Our Navy was released in 1918 as a “recruitment and promotion film depicting the U.S. Navy at the height of World War I.”[2] At the time it was described as “the most complete series of pictures of our navy that (had) yet been presented to the public, and also the most attractive for the reason that they (were) projected in natural colors…” [3] Drawn by these promises of spectacular technological innovation, the teenage friends Leopold Godowski Jr., an aspiring violinist, and Leopold Mannes, also a talented musician, were unimpressed by a drab experience the film had delivered. While gaining success as musicians—Godowski Jr. studied violin at UCLA, later joining the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Mannes studied piano at Harvard earning a Pulitzer Music Scholarship and Guggenheim Fellowship—the two remained in contact as part-time chemists and photo hobbyists committed to improving the vivid color Our Navy had failed to produce.   
              </p>

              <p>
                  What followed was a mythical American dream of entrepreneurial success. In 1922, while traveling to Europe for a performance, Mannes befriended a senior partner at the Wall Street investment banking firm Kuhn, Loeb and Co. [4]. Kuhn Loeb gained their prominence by financing the expanding railways of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This included a banking alliance with National City Bank in 1882 [5], as well as companies like Western Union and Westinghouse. I recall Peter James Hudson’s “The National City Bank of New York and Haiti, 1909-1922” and recognize the infinitely complex network of financial mergers, acquisitions and handshakes that would ultimately dictate countless social implications. With the passing of money, power and time, I question how many degrees towards complicity? Then recognize its embedded, inescapable nature. A generation after a banking alliance and only ten years after Roger Farnham wrought financial havoc on Haiti, Kuhn Loeb curiously sent one of their junior associates Lewis L. Strauss to meet the young chemists [6]. 
              </p>

              <p>
                  It’s worth spending a bit more time with Kuhn Loeb’s prized junior associate, Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss. Born in 1896 and raised in Richmond, Virginia, Strauss was the son of Jewish emigrants who worked as shoe jobbers. He excelled in school but was forced to refuse scholarship after contracting typhoid fever, joining the family business instead. In 1917, unable to serve in combat due to a childhood eye injury, Strauss volunteered his time during and after WWI to Herbert Hoover—“my jewel of a secretary,” Hoover recalled [7]. After the war Strauss was offered a five-figure starting salary at Kuhn Loeb, and with continued financial success, Strauss became full partner by age 32, “piling up a fortune.” [8] 
              </p>

              <p>
                  Strauss continued military service in WWII as a “deskbound'' naval officer in Washington. Afterwards he was assigned to the brand-new Atomic Energy Commision by Harry Truman. With charisma and persuasion Strauss convinced Truman to start an H-bomb program, directly opposing “the scientists of the AEC’s General Advisory Committee, chaired by prestigious physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.” [9] After the successfully controversial H-bomb program’s implementation, Strauss resigned and became financial adviser to the Rockefellers. Soon after, in June 1953, he was tapped on the shoulder by President Eisenhower to become chairman of the AEC.
              </p>

              <p>
                  In 1924 Strauss’ resounding effect on an American history of nuclear weaponry, energy, and policy had yet to happen; he was simply visiting the two young Leo’s obsessed with color photography. Strauss believed in what he’d witnessed. Godowski Jr. and Mannes were backed by Kuhn Loeb, financially secured to build a dedicated laboratory and acquire additional patents. By 1930 they had the attention of Eastman Kodak in Rochester, New York and were invited to move and take advantage of Kodak’s research facilities. By 1935, a revolutionary, marketable subtractive color film, Kodachrome, had been developed for 16mm home movies. One year later it was released for 35mm.

              </p>

              <p>
                  It marked the first time that the spectacle of color photography could be mass-produced and marketed to both photo professionals and consumers, “triggering a cultural phenomenon by unleashing a flood of high-quality color images.” [10] [11]
