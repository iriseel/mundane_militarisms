              Description:
              For many of us, the board game is a medium of nostalgia. One might recall childhood memories of quaint and inconsequential—if occasionally tense—evenings-in with family or rainy-day lunchtime activities in elementary school. Indeed, at a time when it's become something of a cliche to point out that our contemporary culture is dominated by digital media (video games perhaps chief among them), it may come as a surprise that, despite its presumed 'obsolescence,' the board game industry is actually amidst a vibrant renaissance. One early success story of this renewed interest in the board game was Twilight Struggle: The Cold War, 1945-1989 (GMT Games, 2005). Developed by Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews, the wargame has gradually gained a devoted fan base—from 2010 to 2015, it was the top-ranked game in user reviews on Boardgamegeek.com (a popular board game forum), and has, to date, sold over 100,000 copies.

          </p>

          <p>
              This success appears to have been imparted by Twilight Struggle's then-novel approach to wargaming. A genre notorious for its complexity, wargaming traces its origins in actual military strategy development, and is usually focused on field tactics across a particular theater of battle, and would often take hours just to set up and multiple days of intensive play to complete one match. Twilight Struggle instead takes the global view—two players, representing the USSR and the US, vie for dominance over the world not through victory in simulated conflict with one another, but by strategically playing cards based on historical events, political figures, and technological developments to vie for geopolitical influence across the world. In doing so, Twilight Struggle greatly simplifies the genre of the wargame, making it significantly more accessible to a general public than its fellow wargames, while also enabling a unique kind of war simulation at the scale of global politics.
          </p>

          <p>
              The version of Cold War history in Twilight Struggle is clearly and intentionally molded by the ideological worldview of militaristic paranoia that pervaded US political culture of the time. As the designers noted in the rulebook, "The game has a very definite point of view… [and] basically accepts all of the internal logic of the Cold War as true—even those parts of it that are demonstrably false." This is reflected in the cards' content, where stereotypes and binary assumptions abound—playing the "Liberation Theology" card awards the USSR player three influence points to distribute across Central American countries, while the "Decolonization" card grants them one influence point in four African and/or South East Asian states, and all the while, the threat of a thermonuclear apocalypse hangs in the air.

          </p>

          <p>
              What, then, takes place when this dark enthrallment with "thinking about the unthinkable" is popularized and brought into the domestic sphere by a game like Twilight Struggle? Despite the designers' self-aware acknowledgement of the game’s fictionality, the game retains an underlying ideology that global warfare is something that can be played, can be managed, can be won, even in the face of nuclear annihilation. But this global perspective of management abstracts the violence of global warfare to a set of cards to be held, concealed, and played, eliminating the agency of soldiers and civilians around the world and reducing their subjecthood to unseen instruments of ludic necropolitics in what Mahshid Mayar calls "heedless feasts of indifference."
          </p>

          <p>
              Simultaneously, Twilight Struggle embeds the players in a binary duel of escalating suspicions—a phenomenon as prevalent in today's geopolitical reality as it was in 1950. The game designers' account of their own thought processes while playing the game illustrate this paranoia: "Areas become important just because your opponent thinks they are important—he must be going there for some reason!" As Alexander R. Galloway writes, when playing such simulations of global conflict, in his case Sid Meier's video game series Civilization (on which Gupta was also a designer), "The gamer is… learning, internalizing, and becoming intimate with a massive, multipart, global algorithm." That is to say, Twilight Struggle does not merely portray a paranoid narrative of a binary Cold War superpowers, but in fact inculcates a subjectivity in which one enacts and embodies that paranoia.
          </p>

          <p>
              It is then especially alarming to learn that Twilight Struggle has played a role in bringing wargaming back into realpolitik. The RAND Corporation recently released its first commercially available wargame, Hedgemony: A Game of Strategic Choices (The RAND Corporation, 2020), which is derived from a wargame they developed as a policy tool with the Department of Defense to design the 2018 US National Defense Strategy. The authors of Hedgemony reference GMT Games' work as an inspiration, and specifically call out Twilight Struggle as one of these sources. Played out through a set of cards and dice rolls, the game's system is remarkably similar to Twilight Struggle, where players compete to attain geopolitical influence to meet strategic goals rather than necessarily or exclusively engage in open warfare. One card makes premonitory reference to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, which plays out a scenario in which Russia invades a non-NATO European neighbor, and the 2018 Defense Strategy's requisition of increased military spending in Eastern Europe reflected that prediction, which Russia in turn claimed as an escalation of conflict—and we have seen its horrific consequences unfold in the last days. Without denying the Russian state's own responsibility and imperialist aggression, one must also wonder, at what point do Hedgemony and Twilight Struggle’s worldview of suspicion become self-fulfilling prophecy, especially as the RAND Corporation itself invites laypeople to join in the ludic pleasure of global conflict?
          </p>

          <p>
              Indeed, the military continues to find Hedgemony useful—it is now employed as a pedagogical tool for war colleges as well, training the gaze of future military and state officials in the ideology of suspicion necessary for the ongoing game of world-making. In his article reviewing its use in his own courses at the Marine Corps War College, Colonel Brian W. Cole includes a telling account of the experience of one student-player: "'I felt like everyone was out to get us, all the time, from every angle,' claimed one of the students who represented the United States. It is an accurate statement because life as a hegemon is fraught with endless competition."
