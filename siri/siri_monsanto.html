              If ongoing war is justified by predicating an extractivist mode of life upon the extinguishment of other modes of living, pesticides, in both their function and history, epitomize this double action of protection through extermination. The liquid movement of pesticides through private and public spaces highlights the arbitrariness and porousness of distinctions between wartime and peacetime and between domestic, agricultural, and militarized demarcations of territory. In the form of pesticide, freshly scented militarism coats crops, decorates walls, seeks out surfaces to cling to.

              DDT — WWII
              Developed in the 1940s by Monsanto and other agrochemical companies as one of the first modern synthetic insecticides, DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was initially and widely used to combat insect-borne human diseases in World War II. U.S. soldiers were issued DDT powder to sprinkle on their sleeping bags, allegedly with no adverse effects. DDT was hailed as another testament to the wonders of modern science, miraculously targeting only unwanted vermin with pinpoint precision, without causing any collateral damage.

              DDT — Wallpaper
              Even before the war had fully ended, the next one was being prepared. In 1944, Popular Mechanics magazine described “Our Next World War – Against Insects”: “This one will be a long and bitter battle to crush the creeping, wriggling, flying, burrowing billions whose numbers and depredations baffle human comprehension.” This prediction was verified when the U.S. War Production Board released DDT for civilian use in August 1945. This transition of markets marked less the end of one war than the transformed continuation of its mentality and deeper saturation (or rather, aeration) into everyday life: Time magazine announced DDT’s unrestricted release for civilian use on the same page that displayed photos of the atom bomb on Hiroshima.
          </p>

          <p>
              DDT was not only widely used on American farms, but within homes. With the full approval and reassurance of the government and a pointed advertorial targeting of “housewives,” pesticides containing “the amazing wartime chemical DDT” flew off suburban supermarket shelves. One such product was branded as Insect-O-Blitz, alluding to the Nazi military tactic. Another brand of aerosol spray, Bug a Boo, boasted in large, bold print that it contained DDT that far exceeded the US Government standards for insecticides. As one consumer, Sally Edelstein, remembered, the spray imparted a pine scent that felt “like bringing a bit of the outdoors right into our home.”  
          </p>

          <p>
              This fragrance infused not just the living room and kitchen, but even the most highly guarded inner sanctum of the white suburban household and arguably the bastion of its moral panic and paranoia — the nursery. In 1947, wallpaper company Trimz launched its line of DDT wallpapers for children’s rooms. Among other glowing commendations, one Trimz ad proclaimed:
                •	“NON-HAZARDOUS to children or adults, to pets or clothes. Certified to be absolutely safe for home use. Tested and commended by Parents’ Magazine.”
                •	“BEAUTIFUL! ‘Jack and Jill’ or ‘Disney Favorites’ — gay new patterns that protect as they beautify a child’s room.”
                •	“DDT CEILING PAPERS, TOO! Extra protection for your children’s room — for every other room in the house.”
            Upon an obstetrician’s recommendation, Edelstein’s own parents fortified her nursery walls with such wallpaper. The war was brought home as fixture, security, sanctuary. War as literal backdrop, decorative and child-friendly.

              DDT — Vietnam War
              During the Vietnam War, DDT returned to the military stage in Operation Flyswatter, sprayed amongst a cornucopia of insecticides across Vietnam as part of an effort to combat mosquito-transmitted malaria. Although sprayed by the same aircraft that showered Agent Orange across the land as part of the more overtly bellicose Operation Ranch Hand, DDT was conceived of as a universally benevolent poison, with helicopters broadcasting the message that the spraying “posed no threat to people, animals, or crops.”
          </p>

          <p>
              Roundup — Plan Colombia
              DDT has since been classified as a probable human carcinogen by U.S. and international authorities, but Monsanto has maintained its relevance in military and agricultural markets through more recent products, most prominently its glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup. Sold in 130 countries, glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in history, and studies have shown that a majority of food products in the U.S. carry its residue. In a way, Monsanto’s genetically modified Roundup Ready plants are the closest realization of scientist Albert Kligman’s fantasy of the idiophylactic soldier, their very nature engineered to be capable of enduring a targeted annihilation.
          </p>

          <p>
              But Monsanto has found further applications for glyphosate. In Colombia, U.S. taxpayers have funded the use of Roundup Ultra to aerially spray illicit crops since 1986, a vivid extension of Operation Ranch Hand into the arena of counter-narcoterrorism. From 1994 to 2015, militarized aerial fumigation of illicit crops like coca was a keystone of US-Colombia antidrug policy. As scholar Kristina Lyons summarizes, crop duster planes sprayed concentrated Monsanto glyphosate over “illicit crops, and also forests, soils, pastures, livestock, watersheds, subsistence food and human bodies.” The formula used in fumigation operations was estimated to be 110% more concentrated than the commercially available version, and was also mixed with the additive Cosmo-Flux 411 F — a combination that can increase the herbicide’s biological action fourfold. While the Roundup/Cosmo-Flux mixture has never been scientifically evaluated and its use would not be acceptable in the U.S. without prior testing, more than 1.8 million hectares of Colombian coca have already been aerially fumigated with this blend since 1994. Pointing to local health complaints of skin and gastric disorders and livestock deaths, NGOs and rural communities have long condemned aerial aspiration as “chemical warfare.” To which the U.S. and Colombian governments maintained that there was no scientific proof that the fumigating formula caused such “unintended” harm — that is, until 2015, when the Colombian government finally passed a resolution to suspend aerial aspersion with glyphosate. This came in the wake of a report published by the World Health Organization’s cancer research arm that reclassified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen to humans.
          </p>

          <p>
              Prior to this classification, the only possibility local populations had for any compensation from the government was to file quejas (complaints or grievances) for wrongful fumigation of licit crops. Yet not only were these quejas processed, investigated, and judged by the very same agency that operated the fumigations, they were also subject to impossibly exacting demands for “temporal, spatial and scalar synchronization between dates, hours, GPS coordinates, crop duster flight plans, illicit-crop monitoring maps and visibly recognizable in-situ destroyed crops.” As Lyons puts it, “Disputes over claims, among other inconsistencies, have revolved around mismatching temporal registers, political indisposition, and essentialist logics that are systematically biased against the socioeconomic and infrastructural conditions of rural communities residing in the country’s transitioning ‘post-conflict’ zones.” As a result, of the 17,643 quejas that have been filed since 2001, 96% have been rejected.

          </p>

          <p>
              In light of such a predicament, and in a manner vividly resonant with what Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu describes in the case of Vietnamese women living in the aftermath of the Vietnam War as “a salvage sensibility that does not rely on the progressive narrative of moving on, and the demand for reparation, redress, and reconciliation,” Lyons asks of Colombian rural communities, “When state-mediated forms of justice become unlikely or impossible, how might justice be imagined and actualized through everyday material practices?” “What other potentialities and limits emerge among communities that are responding to war by cultivating life, which is not altogether separate from death?” Arising from conversations with Colombian farmers, Lyons traces their practice of what they call selva (inadequately translated as “jungle”) or Amazonian practices — everyday relational, reparative, and material ecological practices that encompass a spirit of mutual obligation between human and non-human lifeforms; the cultivation of “weeds” and nontraditionally commercial varieties that do not require replanting after each harvest, purchased seeds, chemical inputs, or daily upkeep; and a recognition of both the harm of state-sanctioned programs like aerial fumigation as well as the harm caused to the land by farmers themselves through decades of coca monoculture.
          </p>

          <p>
              In describing selva or Amazonian agriculture, Lyons depicts the everyday practices wherein “not only people but entire ecologies — trees, soils, plants, seeds, insects, chickens, microbes, and farmers” create conditions for life in a poisoned and militarized landscape. They do so in part “by becoming into death rather than working against it in the pursuit of a better life,” where becoming into death refers to “a mode of dying that is an aspect of the transformation of being, an emerging into many other living and dying things much like the regenerative decay of hojarasca or decomposing leaves. This kind of death results from the recycling of selva life rather than the violence of war, or, what is the same, killing in the defense of growth.” This becoming into death goes together with a “germinating withdrawal” from colonizing, extractive, and neoliberal agricultural imperatives. In this “decompositional mode of retreat,” families cycle through “underemployment, displacement, landlessness, lying low, and the ongoingness of recovery. They were not in the business of imposing conditions to make productive soils or—in a broader sense—productive lives emerge. Rather, each day Nelso and Elva bring together seeds, manure, eggshells, husks, and vegetable and fruit skins to create conditions for their intermingling in anticipation of what might emerge.” Through such processes, Colombian farmers produce what Lyons terms an “evidentiary ecology” that retains the traces of violence while also “senti-actuando (feel-acting)” alternative forms of justice.
          </p>

          <p>
              Such practices continue to germinate consideration in light of a possible reversal of the 2015 suspension of aerial fumigation. Although thwarted for the time being by a decision from the Colombian Constitutional Court, the presidency of Ivan Duque seems determined to revive aerial glyphosate fumigation in order to, as it claims, combat drug trafficking. Under the constant specter of the return of war both through latent past effects and imminent future waging, how do we learn from and imagine ways of living and dying in which, as Lyons puts it, “death is allowed to decompose into life, rather than being violently ripped from place, territory, soil, selva, and home”?
