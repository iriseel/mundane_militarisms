      <p class="about">
        Militarism has become our common sense and social order. It shapes how we inhabit, navigate, and perceive our immediate world. Mundane Militarisms is a collective effort to catalog the forms of militarism that have become so pervasive and so permanent that they tend to go unnoticed. Shifting away from hypervisible modes of spectacularized violence, our project restores critical legibility to war, surveillance, policing, and security at the level of habitual encounters, routine objects, quotidian sensibilities, and popular culture. Treating militarism as a kind of ordinary violence means drawing on less prestigious and more diffuse modes of evidence. Whereas official archives often house rare and special items that call for strict regulations and heightened security, the objects in Mundane Militarisms are taken from public life and everyday living. Our archive is an intimate surround rather than a subterranean crypt. We are more concerned with surfaces than with recesses. We seek not to retrieve the arcana of war but to describe its physiognomy.

        This shift in scale and orientation reflects our position within the interdisciplinary humanities, our attunement to culture and aesthetics, and our indebtedness to anti-racist and anti-imperialist womxn of color critique. As members of Yale University, we harbor an acute awareness of the racist, sexist, imperialist, and settler legacies embedded in our institutional location. We make a special effort to register these legacies in documenting our encounters with everyday militarisms.
