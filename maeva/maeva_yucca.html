                  Yucca Mountain: Abridged Chronology

          <div class="description">
            <p>
                Time Immemorial

              </p>

            <p>
                Yucca Mountain lies asleep like a snake. – Corbin Harney, Shoshone elder and spiritual leader (qtd. in Endres 2013, 194)
              </p>

              <p>
                  Thousands of Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  Human life picks up around Yucca Mountain. Modern names for peoples living in the area include the Paiute, Shoshone, Quoeech, Washoe, and Walapai tribes.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Three Hundred to One Hundred Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  Land including Yucca Mountain is annexed by the Spanish Empire. The same land later constitutes part of the independent nation of Mexico, then part of the independent nation of the United States. The United States signs a treaty with Shoshone and Paiute tribes that grants it the right to limited uses of the land, including the establishment of mines, ranches, settlements, and military posts. At no point do Shoshone or Paiute tribes cede their claim of sovereignty over Yucca Mountain or surrounding land.
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Eighty Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  Tribal and general public access to lands including Yucca Mountain is cut off by the United States’ establishment of the Nevada National Security Site (Nevada Test Site) for nuclear testing. Fences, roads, and bunkers crisscross the land. Towns are built to be destroyed by nuclear blasts; data is collected. Various forms of plant and animal life become radioactive. When nuclear tests move underground, subsidence craters appear: formerly flat terrain collapses to form bowl-like depressions above disturbed ground.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Nevada is a “national sacrifice zone.” – Danielle Endres (2013, 333)
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Seventy Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  As part of its Cold War “Atoms for Peace” program, the United States advances nuclear energy as a “peaceful” use of nuclear power that can promote global development and expand US influence. Nuclear energy later becomes an important part of US energy independence, considered a key part of national security strategy. Environmental advocates point to nuclear energy as a green alternative to fossil fuels with comparatively low health risk and environmental impact.
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Forty Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  The United States Congress amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate Yucca Mountain as the only site at which the Department of Energy can develop plans for nuclear waste storage/disposal. Almost all nuclear waste in the United States is produced by the nuclear energy industry, rather than by the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Thirty Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  The United States ends full-scale nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site. Nuclear weapons research and development continues at the site, including “subcritical testing.” Hundreds of antinuclear protests are held near Yucca Mountain, involving some 37 thousand participants.
              </p>

              <p>
                  “the physical threat, vague yet omnipresent, structures our response. […] Nuclear landscapes are landscapes of fear.” – Peter Goin, photographer (1991, xix)
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Twenty Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  The United States government officially authorizes Yucca Mountain as the nation’s permanent nuclear waste storage facility, pending Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing. NRC investigations into the viability of nuclear waste storage in Yucca Mountain begin, including the construction of a 5-mile “exploratory tunnel” underneath the mountain and the extraction of 75 thousand feet of core and 18 thousand geological and water samples.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Activists including local Native people increase anti-repository organizing efforts in the area. Their activities include “scientific monitoring of streams and groundwater; the development of grassroots environmental impact assessments and 'peoples’ policies' on nuclear waste; a public art competition to develop a warning sign for Yucca Mountain that could communicate the dangers of radioactive waste for 10,000 years; creative fiction and non-fiction writing; civil disobedience and environmental direct action; documentary film; prayer circles, toxic tours and spirit walks and a travelling mobile museum that documented the atomic history of the region.” (Houston 2012, 425)
              </p>

              <p>
                  “The Yucca Mountain facility is important to achieving a number of our national goals. It will promote our energy security, our national security, and safety in our homeland. It will help strengthen our economy and help us clean up the environment.” – Spencer Abraham, US Secretary of Energy (DOE 2002, 1)
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Ten Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  The United States government suspends licensing of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste disposal site in response to political pressure from the people of Nevada.
              </p>

              <p>
                  About Two Years Ago
              </p>

              <p>
                  Having invested twenty years of research and over $10.5 billion in taxpayer money, the United States government cuts all funding for developing Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste disposal site. No alternative sites for nuclear waste disposal are proposed. To celebrate the occasion, the grassroots organization Citizen Alert closes after 30 years of advocacy.
              </p>

              <p>
                  “Yucca Mountain is dead and will remain dead. This has been true for a long, long time.” – Senator Harry Reid, Twitter (2020)

              </p>

              <p>
                  United States taxpayers collectively pay about $6 billion per year to manage high-level waste leftover from nuclear weapons development, plus about $500 thousand per year to utility companies that manage nuclear waste produced by the nuclear energy industry. Efforts by the United States government to find a long-term solution to nuclear waste storage have stalled. Yucca Mountain remains essentially inaccessible to local people as a result of government and military regulation. Limited nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site continues.

              </p>

              <p>
                  Fossil fuel usage continues to diminish the availability of land hospitable to human life, push down health outcomes, increase “natural” disaster, and raise global conflict. Populations in the "developing" world are most acutely affected. Investments in nuclear energy today could mitigate future harm.

              <p>
                  Paiute and Shoshone people maintain legal, cultural, and spiritual ties to their tribal lands. The United States maintains its claim of legal sovereignty over Nevada.

              </p>

              <p>
                  The nuclear contents of dry storage casks inside Yucca Mountain are depleted; the radioactivity is spent. Cement cylinders remain inside the mountain.

                  Tens of Thousands of Years from Now
              </p>

              <p>
                  Nuclear waste produced today loses its radioactivity.

              <p>
                  Someday
              </p>

              <p>
                  Someday when we wake that snake up, we will have to sit down and talk to that snake. It will get mad and rip open. When it awakens, we will all go to sleep. With his tail, that snake will move the mountain, rip it open, and the poison will come out on the surface. – Corbin Harney (qtd. in Endres 2013, 194)
